83945793475,Atomic Habit,James Clear,Self-Help Book,English,2024-07-26,"Atomic Habits Summary  3 Key Lessons from Atomic Habits This section of the Atomic Habits summary presents key points from three of the core themes of the book.   Lesson 1: Small habits make a big difference  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.   Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable— sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s  how  the math works out: if you can  get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.  It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success.   Focus on getting 1 percent better every day.   Lesson 2: Forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.   Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.  If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.  You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.  Atomic Habits presents a proven system for building good habits and breaking bad ones.  Lesson 3: Build identity-based habits  The key to building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first. Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity. What you do now is a mirror image of the type of person you believe that you are (either consciously or subconsciously).  To change your behavior for good, you need to start believing new things about yourself. You need to build identity-based habits.  Changing your beliefs isn’t nearly as hard as you might think. There are two steps.  Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.  How to build better habits in 4 simple steps This section of the Atomic Habits summary presents key points from the actionable strategies in the book, organized around a framework called the Four Laws of Behavior Change.     The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.   Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it.   The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.  We can transform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.  The framework is called the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones.  How to create a good habit:   The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.  The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.  The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.  The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying. How to break a bad habit:  Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.  Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.  Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.  Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.

Atomic Habits summary on how to create a good habit Atomic Habits summary on how to break a bad habit Popular Atomic Habits quotes “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it is actually big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.”  Atomic Habits, page 38  “All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.”  – Atomic Habits, page 22  “The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.”  – Atomic Habits, page 27  You can browse more popular Atomic Habits quotes here.

Fundamental Techniques in Handling People  2. Six Ways to Make People Like You  3. How to Win People To Your Way of Thinking  4. Be a Leader: How to Change People      Principle Overview:  World famous psychologist B.F. Skinner proved that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much faster and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior.  Since then, further studies have shown that this same principle applies to humans as well: Criticizing others doesn’t yield anything positive.  We aren’t able to make real changes by criticizing people, and we’re instead often met with resentment. It’s important to remember that when dealing with people, we’re dealing not with creatures of logic, but with creatures of emotion, who are motivated by pride and ego.     Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes them strive to justify themselves. DALE CARNEGIE     Practice Principle 1:  Do you know someone you would like to change in some way? When you find yourself getting caught up in other people’s annoying habits or behaviors, think of a few reasons they might be acting the way they are.    Say to yourself, “I should forgive them for this because …” and conclude this sentence with an open mind. You’ll be in a much better position to hold back from criticizing.    HBR Resource: Candor, Criticism, Teamwork    Principle Overview:  The only way we can get a person to do anything is by giving them what they want.  What do most people want?  Health, food, sleep, money, sex. Most of these wants are usually gratified, but there is one longing, almost as deep and ingrained as the desire for food or sleep, that is seldom gratified: the desire to be important.     The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated. WILLIAM JAMES  We tend to take the people in our lives for granted so often that we neglect to let them know that we appreciate them. We must be careful to keep in mind the difference between appreciation and flattery, which seldom works with discerning people, as it is shallow, selfish and insincere.    Flattery comes from the tongue; appreciation comes from the heart.  Day in and day out, we spend most of our time thinking about ourselves. But if we stop thinking about ourselves for a bit and start thinking about other people’s strengths, we wouldn’t have to resort to cheap flattery and we could offer honest, sincere appreciation.    With words of true appreciation, we have the power to completely change another person’s perception of themselves, improve their motivation, and be a driving force behind their success. When you think about it like that - when we have nothing to lose and only positive outcomes to gain - why wouldn’t we offer genuine appreciation more often?   Principle Overview:  Perhaps your favorite dessert is strawberry cheesecake. Excellent choice! Now, if you were to go fishing, would you bait your hook with cheesecake? Of course not -- that’s what you like, but fish prefer worms.    Lloyd George, Great Britain’s Prime Minister during World War I, who stayed in power long after the other wartime leaders had been forgotten, was asked how he managed to remain on top. His response: He had learned that it is necessary to “bait the hook to suit the fish.”    In other words, give people what they want, not what you want.     ""Of course, you are interested in what you want. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want."" DALE CARNEGIE  This principle is absolutely key in influencing others.    To convince someone to do something, we have to frame it in terms of what motivates them. And in order to do that, we have to be able to see things from their point of view as well as our own.    Most salespeople spend a lifetime selling without seeing things from the customer’s angle, wondering why they’re not successful as they completely ignore the customer’s needs.    If we can put aside our own thoughts, opinions, and wants, and truly see things from another person’s perspective, we will be able to convince them that it is in their best interest to do whatever it is we’re after.     ""The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition."" DALE CARNEGIE  Practice Principle 3:  Next time you want to persuade someone to do something, before you speak, pause and ask yourself, “How can I make this person want to do it? How can I frame this in terms of her wants?”  When you’re writing an email that contains a request, try replacing “I” and “my” with “you” and “your” as much as possible. Craft your language to make it about them.  Entrepreneur Resource: 9 Habits of Persuasive Business LeadersSix-Ways-to-Make-People-Like-You    We are often tempted to argue with others, especially when we are absolutely convinced that we’re right about something. But even if we are right, what does arguing about it yield? Why prove someone else wrong? Is that going to make the person like us? Why not just let him save face, if we have nothing to gain from it but “feeling” superior?    Not to mention, nine times out of 10, arguing just results in the other person even more firmly convinced that he is right.    According to Carnegie, it’s impossible to win an argument. If we lose the argument, we lose; if we win the argument, we have made the other person feel inferior, hurt his pride, and made him resent us. In other words, we still lose.     ""There is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it."" DALE CARNEGIE  What if, instead of arguing with someone, we admit their importance through appreciation? This can expand the other person’s ego so he can then become sympathetic and kind.  To keep a disagreement from becoming an argument, we can:  Welcome the disagreement. If the other person is raising a point we haven’t considered, we can be thankful it’s brought to our attention. It may save us from making a mistake. Distrust our first instinctive impression. Our natural reaction to a disagreeable situation is to become defensive. We should keep calm and watch out for how we first react. Control our temper. Only negative outcomes result from a bad temper. Listen first. We can give our opponents a chance to talk without interrupting, and let them finish without resisting, defending, or debating. Look for areas of agreement. Surface those first. Be honest. Look for areas where we can admit error and apologize for our mistakes. This helps reduce defensiveness. Promise to think over our opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Thank our opponents sincerely for their interest. If they’re taking the time to argue with us, they’re interested in the same things we are. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. In the meantime, ask ourselves honestly if our opponents might be right, or partly right. Next time you find yourself in a disagreement with someone, don’t respond with criticism or a negative email. Instead, sleep on it. You’d be surprised how much perspective you can gain by giving yourself a bit of time to think the situation over.  Grammar Resource: Negative Words to Avoid in Writing   Along similar lines of not engaging in arguments, we should also avoid telling someone that they’re plain wrong. If we begin by announcing that we’re going to prove something to someone, we’re essentially telling them that we are smarter than they are and we’re going to teach them a thing or two.  This comes off as a challenge. It arouses opposition and incites in the other person a desire to battle with us.      ""If you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel you are doing it."" DALE CARNEGIE   Even when we’re talking on the phone, our smile comes through in our voices.    Carnegie tells a story of a computer department manager who was desperately trying to recruit a PhD for his department. He finally found the perfect candidate, but the boy also had offers from much larger and better known companies. When the boy told the manager that he was choosing his company, the manager asked why.    The boy explained: ""I think it was because managers in the other companies spoke on the phone in a cold business-like manner, which made me feel like just another business transaction. Your voice sounded as if you were glad to hear from me … that you really wanted me to be part of your organization.""    A simple smile can go a long way.  Practice Principle 2:  This one is simple: Challenge yourself to smile at someone every hour of the day for a full week.   Principle Overview:  A person's name is a very powerful thing - it's an embodiment of that person's identity. It's a reference to them. So remembering and using someone's name is a great way to make that person feel important.     ""The average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together."" DALE CARNEGIE  Calling someone by their name is like paying them a very subtle compliment. Conversely, forgetting or misspelling someone's name can have the opposite effect and make it feel as though we are distant and disinterested in them.    Remembering and using people's names is also a critical component of good leadership. The executive who can't remember his employees' names can't remember a significant part of his business, and is operating on quicksand.    Yet, most people don't remember names for the simple reason that they don't put in the effort to. We make excuses that we are too busy. We are introduced to a stranger and forget his name only a few minutes later.     ""The information we are imparting or the request we are making takes on a special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual. From the waitress to the senior executive, the name will work magic as we deal with others."" DALE CARNEGIE  Practice Principle 3:  Next time you meet someone new, make a sincere effort to remember her name. Repeat her name several times and try to associate it in your mind with her features or expression, or something you've learned about her.  If it is an uncommon name, ask her to repeat it or spell it for you. Then write it down later so you can visualize the name too.  Free Tool: Just as asking someone to repeat their name for the fifth time can be taken as frustrating, so can asking ""have you seen my email yet?"" With Sidekick, you can see when your emails are opened and avoid having to irk recipients with continuous probing.   Principle Overview:  Carnegie explains that he once attended a dinner party where he met a botanist whom he found to be absolutely fascinating. He listened for hours with excitement as the botanist spoke of exotic plants and indoor gardens, until the party ended and everyone left.    Before leaving, the botanist told the host of the dinner party that Carnegie was a “most interesting conversationalist” and gave him several compliments.    Of course, Carnegie had hardly said anything at all. What he had done was listen intently. He listened because he was genuinely interested.    “And so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist when, in reality, I had been merely a good listener and had encouraged him to talk,” Carnegie notes.  Even the most ill-tempered person, the most violent critic, will often be subdued in the presence of a patient, sympathetic listener.    Take for example, a store clerk. If the clerk constantly interrupts and irritates customers, those customers are more likely to start arguments and bring frustrations and complaints to the store manager. But a clerk who is willing to listen could calm even a customer who storms in already angry.    Most of us are so concerned with what we are going to say next that we don’t truly listen when someone else is speaking. Yet, most people would prefer a good listener to a good talker.     ""If you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you, here is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself. If you have an idea while the other person is talking, don’t wait for him or her to finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence."" DALE CARNEGIE  Remember that the people we are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their own problems than they are in us and our problems.  Practice Principle 4:  Next time you have a conversation, pay attention to how much of the conversation is you talking vs. the other person talking. How much listening are you doing?  Aim to do 75% listening and 25% talking.  As you practice this, pay attention to what causes you to jump in with more talking. Are you filling awkward silences? Do you tend to get carried away when you tell stories or share ideas? Think of some ways you can encourage the other person to do more of the sharing.   Principle Overview:  We now understand that people like to talk about themselves and have others be interested in them. The next best thing to talking about themselves is talking about the things that they enjoy.    Whenever Theodore Roosevelt expected a visitor, he would stay up late the night before, reading up on whatever subject he knew particularly interested his guest. And that is because Roosevelt was keenly aware of the following idea:     ""The royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most."" THEODORE ROOSEVELT  Carnegie describes a story from a man named Edward Chalif, who was planning to ask the president of one of the largest corporations in America to pay for his son to go on a Boy Scout trip.    Before Mr. Chalif went to see him, he had heard that this man had drawn up a check for a million dollars, and that after it was canceled, he had had it framed. Upon meeting the man, he mentioned how much he admired the check and would love to see it.    The man was thrilled! He talked about the check for some time, until he realized he hadn’t asked why Mr. Chalif was there to see him. When Mr. Chalif mentioned his request, the man agreed without any questions and even offered to fund the trip for several other boys as well.    Mr. Chalif later explained, “If I hadn’t found out what he was interested in, and got him warmed up first, I wouldn’t have found him one-tenth as easy to approach.”    Talking in terms of the other person’s interests benefits both parties.   How often do we notice someone who looks very down, or bored - perhaps someone whose job is very repetitive or someone whose boss doesn’t give him or her much recognition? Maybe it’s a store clerk, or the mailman, or our hair dresser. What could we say to that person to cheer them up?    We could think of something about them that we honestly admire. This might sometimes be difficult with a stranger, but we should push ourselves to think of something, and mention it to them.    When Carnegie describes having this type of interactions with a stranger, he notes that many people have asked him what he was trying to get out of the person. His response:     ""If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can’t radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return - if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve."" DALE CARNEGIE  In other words, we should all be happy - and excited - to do something for someone else when they can’t do anything for us in return. As we’ve reiterated throughout each of these principles, the one all-important law of human conduct is to always make the other person feel important.    And just as the Golden Rule states, “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.”  Practice Principle 6:  Find someone who doesn’t appear to be having a good day - perhaps a demotivated colleague, an overworked waitress, or a man selling newspapers on the corner. Go out of your way to offer words of kindness to that person through a genuine compliment. Aim to do this at least once every day.    We are often tempted to argue with others, especially when we are absolutely convinced that we’re right about something. But even if we are right, what does arguing about it yield? Why prove someone else wrong? Is that going to make the person like us? Why not just let him save face, if we have nothing to gain from it but “feeling” superior?    Not to mention, nine times out of 10, arguing just results in the other person even more firmly convinced that he is right.    According to Carnegie, it’s impossible to win an argument. If we lose the argument, we lose; if we win the argument, we have made the other person feel inferior, hurt his pride, and made him resent us. In other words, we still lose.     ""There is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it.""",4,2
879538792489,Dune,Frank Herbert,Sci-Fi,English,2024-04-15,"In the far future, manipulation of the equations necessary for interstellar travel can only be accomplished through the aid of the narcotic “spice” or “melange,” which can only be found on one planet, Arrakis—also called Dune. The galaxy is divided into aristocratic houses under the leadership of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. Fearing the rise of House Atreides of the oceanic planet Caladan, Shaddam IV orders House Atreides to take over Arrakis and spice mining from their longtime enemies House Harkonnen but plans to help the Harkonnens destroy the Atreides after their arrival on Arrakis.  Alien planet, fantasy world, water, mountains Britannica Quiz Fantasy Lands Duke Leto, leader of House Atreides, suspects a trap. His concubine Lady Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, an entirely female religious group that through its manipulation of aristocratic bloodlines over millennia hopes to produce a superbeing, the Kwisatz Haderach. Jessica was to have given birth to a daughter who would have married a Harkonnen and would have likely produced the Kwisatz Haderach as their son. Instead, because of her love for Leto, who desired a son, she bore Paul, trained him in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, and hopes that he could be the Kwisatz Haderach. Paul already shows signs of extraordinary capabilities with his prophetic dreams of life on Arrakis.  Once on Arrakis, Leto proves himself a benevolent ruler, a contrast to the harsh ruler Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. He saves the crew of a spice harvester from being swallowed by a giant sandworm and reaches out to Stilgar, a leader of the Fremen, the human inhabitants of the desert. However, the Harkonnens, aided by the emperor’s Sardaukar troops, launch their attack. Duke Leto is betrayed to the Harkonnens by his doctor, Wellington Yueh, who seeks to free his wife from Harkonnen captivity, but Yueh also arranges for Paul and Jessica to escape their captors and flee into the desert. Yueh delivers Leto to Baron Harkonnen but not before putting in his mouth a false tooth that will release a lethal vapor when bitten. Leto crushes the tooth and dies but fails to kill the baron.  Exposed to the spice-filled desert, Paul’s latent abilities to discern both the past and the future begin to awaken. He reveals to Jessica her origins as a daughter of Baron Harkonnen, and he sees visions of the future in which the Fremen unleash a jihad on the galaxy in his name. He and Jessica join the “sietch” (Fremen community) led by Stilgar, and Paul meets a young woman, Chani, whom he recognizes from his earlier visions. Among the Fremen, Paul assumes the name “Paul-Muad’Dib.” Paul and Jessica discover that Stilgar and the Fremen have large underground caches of water in order to change Arrakis from a desert world to one rich in water.  The Fremen’s religion was influenced by the Bene Gesserit, and Jessica agrees to replace the old reverend mother at Stilgar’s sietch. She drinks the Water of Life, which grants her the memories of previous reverend mothers going back millennia. The Water of Life also grants the same awareness to her unborn daughter, Alia.  Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now Paul trains the Fremen in the Weirding Way, the Bene Gesserit technique of hand-to-hand combat, and he and the Fremen throttle spice production through their raids. He and Chani have a son, Leto II. Paul fully embraces the Fremen culture and is regarded by them as their promised messiah. Paul and Stilgar have a skirmish with a band of spice smugglers in the desert and discover that they are led by Gurney Halleck, an adviser of Duke Leto who instructed Paul in the use of weapons. Gurney attempts to kill Jessica, believing that it was she who betrayed Duke Leto to the Harkonnens. Paul and Jessica convince him of the truth, but Paul is concerned that he did not foresee Gurney’s attack. He takes a drop of the Water of Life to increase his clairvoyant power.  After three weeks in a coma, Paul awakens with the awareness that he is indeed the Kwisatz Haderach long planned by the Bene Gesserit and that the emperor and Baron Harkonnen have come to Arrakis to attack the Fremen and restart spice production. As Paul is preparing to attack the capital, Arrakeen, Sardaukar troops raid a sietch where they believe Paul to be. The Sardaukar capture Alia and kill Paul’s son. Brought before the emperor and the baron as Paul begins his attack, Alia kills the baron with a poison needle. Paul and the Fremen capture Arrakeen. The baron’s nephew, Feyd-Rautha, challenges Paul to single combat and loses. Paul threatens the emperor with planetwide destruction of the spice unless he abdicates in favor of Paul. The emperor does so and grants Paul his daughter Irulan’s hand in marriage. Paul restores House Atreides to its rightful place and destroys the Harkonnens but must live knowing that the Fremen’s zealous worship of him will lead to a jihad that will rage across the universe.  Publication and adaptations In 1957 Herbert visited Florence, Oregon, to write a story about how the U.S. Department of Agriculture stopped the advance of sand dunes by introducing European beach grass. He was further inspired to study the ecology of deserts and began thinking about how religions, particularly Islam, had arisen in a desert background. Much of the Fremen culture was based on that of the Bedouin, and Paul’s journey was inspired by the story of T.E. Lawrence (“Lawrence of Arabia”).  Dune was first serialized in Analog; the first part, “Dune World,” appeared from December 1963 to February 1964, and the second part, “The Prophet of Dune,” appeared from January to May 1965. Many publishers rejected the novel. Editor Sterling Lanier at Chilton, a company best known for its automobile repair manuals, felt that Dune would be a good choice for the company to branch out into fiction. Early sales of Dune were poor, and Lanier was fired. However, Dune received the first Nebula Award for best novel and shared the Hugo Award with Roger Zelazny’s This Immortal, and Dune became a popular novel among young people in the late 1960s and ’70s.  Herbert continued the story of Paul, House Atreides, and the future history of humanity in five novels: Dune Messiah (1969), Children of Dune (1976), God Emperor of Dune (1981), Heretics of Dune (1984), and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985). Herbert died in 1986, and in 1999 his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson began writing novels set in the world of Dune.  In the 1970s Chilean-French filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky tried to film Dune and assembled a cast that would have included Salvador Dalí as the emperor and Orson Welles as Baron Harkonnen. The project became one of cinema’s tantalizing unfilmed projects (chronicled in the documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune [2013]), and some film historians contend that, through its extensive and widely circulated preproduction design, it influenced later science fiction movies.  Dino De Laurentiis purchased the rights in 1976, and a poorly received adaptation was filmed by David Lynch (1984), with Kyle MacLachlan (in his film debut) as Paul. A television miniseries aired in 2000, followed by another miniseries (2003) that covered the events in the second and third Dune books.  Dune: Part Two (2024) Dune: Part Two (2024) Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides and Zendaya as Chani in Dune: Part Two (2024). In 2021 French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve released another film adaptation, based on the first half of Dune and starring Timothée Chalamet as Paul. It was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including for best picture, and won 6. Villeneuve adapted the second half of the novel as Dune: Part Two (2024), and an adaptation of Dune Messiah is planned.",4,3

Malheureusement, un détail important se perd au cours de la traduction en anglais –et autres langues. Il s’agit de la traduction de la réplique la plus célèbre, la toute première intervention du Petit Prince lors de sa rencontre avec le pilote dans le désert :

« S’il vous plait, dessine-moi un mouton » (« Please, draw me a sheep »).

Pouvez-vous deviner le problème rencontré par le traducteur ?

Unfortunately, one important detail is lost through the translation into English -among other languages​​. This is the translation of the most famous quote corresponding to the first sentence said by the Little Prince when he meets the pilot in the desert :
“S’il vous plait, dessine-moi un mouton ” (“Please, draw me a sheep”).

Can you guess the problem faced by the translator?

En effet, il y a une incohérence entre l’utilisation formelle/polie de la langue dans « s’il vous plait » et l’utilisation informelle de la requête dans « dessine » ! Le Petit Prince montre ici qu’il ne maîtrise pas totalement la langue, ce qui peut être le cas chez les jeunes enfants mais aussi…chez les étrangers – j’inclus ici ceux qui viennent d’une autre planète 🙂

En anglais, il est impossible d’obtenir le même effet car il n’y a pas de distinction entre le « you » formel/informel.

En français, on dirait :

« S’il te plait, dessine-moi un mouton.» (adresse informelle)
« S’il vous plait, dessinez-moi un mouton. » (adresse formelle)
(Lisez mon article sur la différence entre « tu » et « vous »)

There is an inconsistency between the use of formal / polite language in “s’il vous plait” and the informal use of “dessine”. The Little Prince shows that he has not mastered the language completely, which may be the case for young children but also for foreigners … – I’m including those who come from another planet J
In English, it is impossible to achieve the same effect as there is no distinction between the formal / informal “you”.

In French, we would say:

« S’il te plait, dessine-moi un mouton.» (informal address – « tu » form)
« S’il vous plait, dessinez-moi un mouton. » (formal address – « vous » form)",4,0

89798398429,All Quiet on the Western Front,Erich Maria Remarque,Fiction,English,2024-03-15,"After enduring heavy fighting on the Western front of World War I, a group of German soldiers rest behind the front lines. Over their first good meal in weeks, Paul Bäumer (the novel’s narrator), and his friends Kropp, Tjaden, Leer, Katczinsky (Kat), and Müller bitterly remember how their schoolteacher Kantorek convinced them to enlist in the army with his idealistic and romantic ideas about war and glory. Now they’ve become so pragmatic and focused on mere survival that when they visit Kemmerich, a friend dying in the hospital, Muller asks Kemmerich if he can have Kemmerich’s boots since Kemmerich won’t need them anymore. Paul and his friends spend a lot of time talking about their petty and cruel commander during boot camp, Corporal Himmelstoss. They discuss why men like Himmelstoss, who was a postman in civilian life, become so terrible during war. Kat suggests that the military offers men an outlet for their animalistic impulses. When Himmelstoss is called up to join Paul’s company, Paul remembers how he and his friends ambushed and beat Himmelstoss on the last day of boot camp.

The German army sends Paul’s company back to the front to set up barbed wire. After finishing the job under heavy fire, the company is attacked and forced to take cover in a cemetery. The shelling throws coffins into the air; dead bodies mix with the bodies of the living and dying. Paul and his friends survive, though many don’t. Back at camp, the men discuss what they would do after the war. It’s soon apparent that the younger soldiers in the group, such as Paul, can’t come up with anything. Their lives have been defined by war. Paul thinks of them as “lost.”

All Quiet on the Western Front PDF
A new French offensive begins. The men shelter in a cramped bunker, and the constant French shelling drives some recent reinforcements insane. Himmelstoss, for one, cowers in a bunker pretending to be injured. Paul beats him until an officer orders them both to join a charge against enemy lines. The Germans eventually repel the French attack and make a counter-attack of their own before retreating to their original lines.

Only 32 of the 150 men in Paul’s company survive the battle, and the company is brought off the front line to a depot to reorganize. While there, Paul, Albert and Leer meet three French women who are excited to sleep with soldiers. Soon after, Paul receives enough leave to visit his hometown, where he finds that his mother is suffering from cancer, and that the townspeople, including his father, are supportive of the war and know nothing of its horrific nature. The townspeople’s ignorant patriotism annoys Paul, but also makes him feel distant, as if he’s lost his home. When his leave is up, Paul is sent to a camp on the moors for further training. His duties include guarding Russian prisoners of war, with whom he comes to identify and sympathize as fellow human beings

Eventually Paul is sent back to the front and his company. On an intelligence-gathering mission between enemy lines, he loses his bearings just as a French attack begins. As he waits in a shell hole for the attack to end, a retreating French soldier falls on top of him. Paul stabs the man but does not kill him. As the man slowly dies over the next day, Paul feels regret and does what he can to comfort him. After the shelling ends, Paul returns to camp, and is sent with his friends to guard an abandoned village. Paul and Albert are injured while on patrol, and wind up in a hospital, a frightful and depressing place where doctors sometimes practice unnecessary surgical procedures on injured soldiers. Albert has to have a leg amputated, but Paul recovers and is sent back to the front. Though the Germans are clearly losing, they fight on, and the war rages on into the summer of 1918. Many new recruits go crazy; a soldier named Detering deserts and is captured; Müller, Leer, and Kat are killed. In October of 1918, one month before the long awaited armistice is finally agreed to, Paul is killed on a day of otherwise quiet on the western front. The expression on the face of his dead body is calm, as though he were relieved to be dead.",2,1

PROLOGUE 


Ikigai : A mysterious word 


This book first came into being on a rainy night in Tokyo, when its authors sat 
down together for the first time in one of the city’s tiny bars. 

We had read each other’s work but had never met, thanks to the thousands of 
miles that separate Barcelona from the capital of Japan. Then a mutual 
acquaintance put us in touch, launching a friendship that led to this project and 
seems destined to last a lifetime. 

The next time we got together, a year later, we strolled through a park in 
downtown Tokyo and ended up talking about trends in Western psychology, 
specifically logotherapy, which helps people find their purpose in life. 

We remarked that Viktor Frankl’s logotherapy had gone out of fashion among 
practicing therapists, who favored other schools of psychology, though people 
still search for meaning in what they do and how they live. We ask ourselves 
things like: 

What is the meaning of my life? 

Is the point just to live longer, or should I seek a higher purpose? 

Why do some people know what they want and have a passion for life, while 
others languish in confusion? 

At some point in our conversation, the mysterious word ikigai came up. 

This Japanese concept, which translates roughly as “the happiness of always 
being busy,” is like logotherapy, but it goes a step beyond. It also seems to be one 
way of explaining the extraordinary longevity of the Japanese, especially on the 
island of Okinawa, where there are 24.55 people over the age of 100 for every 
100,000 inhabitants—far more than the global average. 

Those who study why the inhabitants of this island in the south of Japan live 
longer than people anywhere else in the world believe that one of the keys—in 



addition to a healthful diet, a simple life in the outdoors, green tea, and the 
subtropical climate (its average temperature is like that of Hawaii)—is the ikigai 
that shapes their lives. 

While researching this concept, we discovered that not a single book in the 
fields of psychology or personal development is dedicated to bringing this 
philosophy to the West. 

Is ikigai the reason there are more centenarians in Okinawa than anywhere 
else? How does it inspire people to stay active until the very end? What is the 
secret to a long and happy life? 

As we explored the matter further, we discovered that one place in particular, 
Ogimi, a rural town on the north end of the island with a population of three 
thousand, boasts the highest life expectancy in the world—a fact that has earned 
it the nickname the Village of Longevity. 

Okinawa is where most of Japan’s shikuwasa —a limelike fruit that packs an 
extraordinary antioxidant punch—comes from. Could that be Ogimi’s secret to 
long life? Or is it the purity of the water used to brew its Moringa tea? 

We decided to go study the secrets of the Japanese centenarians in person. 
After a year of preliminary research we arrived in the village—where residents 
speak an ancient dialect and practice an animist religion that features long-haired 
forest sprites called bunagaya—with our cameras and recording devices in hand. 
As soon as we arrived we could sense the incredible friendliness of its residents, 
who laughed and joked incessantly amid lush green hills fed by crystalline waters. 

As we conducted our interviews with the eldest residents of the town, we 
realized that something far more powerful than just these natural resources was at 
work: an uncommon joy flows from its inhabitants and guides them through the 
long and pleasurable journey of their lives. 

Again, the mysterious ikigai. 

But what is it, exactly? How do you get it? 

It never ceased to surprise us that this haven of nearly eternal life was located 
precisely in Okinawa, where two hundred thousand innocent lives were lost at the 
end of World War II. Rather than harbor animosity toward outsiders, however, 
Okinawans live by the principle of ichariba chode, a local expression that means 
“treat everyone like a brother, even if you’ve never met them before.” 

It turns out that one of the secrets to happiness of Ogimi’s residents is feeling 
like part of a community. From an early age they practice yuimaaru, or 
teamwork, and so are used to helping one another. 



Nurturing friendships, eating light, getting enough rest, and doing regular, 
moderate exercise are all part of the equation of good health, but at the heart of 
the joie de vivre that inspires these centenarians to keep celebrating birthdays and 
cherishing each new day is their ikigai. 

The purpose of this book is to bring the secrets of Japan’s centenarians to you 
and give you the tools to find your own ikigai. 

Because those who discover their ikigai have everything they need for a long 
and joyful journey through life. 

Happy travels!

IKIGAI 

The art of staying young while 
growing old 



What is your reason for being? 

According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai —what a French philosopher 
might call a raison d’etre. Some people have found their ikigai, while others are 
still looking, though they carry it within them. 

Our ikigai is hidden deep inside each of us, and finding it requires a patient 
search. According to those born on Okinawa, the island with the most 
centenarians in the world, our ikigai is the reason we get up in the morning. 







Whatever you do, don’t retire! 

Having a clearly defined ikigai brings satisfaction, happiness, and meaning to our 
lives. The purpose of this book is to help you find yours, and to share insights 
from Japanese philosophy on the lasting health of body, mind, and spirit. 

One surprising thing you notice, living in Japan, is how active people remain 
after they retire. In fact, many Japanese people never really retire—they keep 
doing what they love for as long as their health allows. 

There is, in fact, no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense of “leaving 
the workforce for good” as in English. According to Dan Buettner, a National 
Geographic reporter who knows the country well, having a purpose in life is so 
important in Japanese culture that our idea of retirement simply doesn’t exist 
there. 


The island of (almost) eternal youth 

Certain longevity studies suggest that a strong sense of community and a clearly 
defined ikigai are just as important as the famously healthful Japanese diet— 
perhaps even more so. Recent medical studies of centenarians from Okinawa and 
other so-called Blue Zones—the geographic regions where people live longest— 
provide a number of interesting facts about these extraordinary human beings: 

■ Not only do they live much longer than the rest of the world’s population, 
they also suffer from fewer chronic illnesses such as cancer and heart 
disease; inflammatory disorders are also less common. 

■ Many of these centenarians enjoy enviable levels of vitality and health that 
would be unthinkable for people of advanced age elsewhere. 

■ Their blood tests reveal fewer free radicals (which are responsible for 
cellular aging), as a result of drinking tea and eating until their stomachs are 
only 80 percent full. 

■ Women experience more moderate symptoms during menopause, and both 
men and women maintain higher levels of sexual hormones until much later 
in life. 

■ The rate of dementia is well below the global average. 


The Characters Behind Ikigai 

In Japanese, ikigai is written as zfecF EPH, combining zfecF, which means 
“life,” with ^§§, which means “to be worthwhile.” can be broken 
down into the characters ^, which means “armor,” “number one,” and “to 
be the first” (to head into battle, taking initiative as a leader), and §§, 
which means “beautiful” or “elegant.” 


Though we will consider each of these findings over the course of the book, 
research clearly indicates that the Okinawans’ focus on ikigai gives a sense of 
purpose to each and every day and plays an important role in their health and 
longevity. 


The five Blue Zones 

Okinawa holds first place among the world’s Blue Zones. In Okinawa, women in 
particular live longer and have fewer diseases than anywhere else in the world. 
The five regions identified and analyzed by Dan Buettner in his book The Blue 
Zones are: 

1. Okinawa, Japan (especially the northern part of the island). The locals eat a 
diet rich in vegetables and tofu typically served on small plates. In addition to 
their philosophy of ikigai , the moai, or close-knit group of friends (see page 
15), plays an important role in their longevity. 

2. Sardinia, Italy (specifically the provinces of Nuoro and Ogliastra). Locals on 
this island consume plenty of vegetables and one or two glasses of wine per 
day. As in Okinawa, the cohesive nature of this community is another factor 
directly related to longevity. 

3. Loma Linda, California. Researchers studied a group of Seventh-day 
Adventists who are among the longest-living people in the United States. 

4. The Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. Locals remain remarkably active after 
ninety; many of the region’s older residents have no problem getting up at 
five thirty in the morning to work in the fields. 



5. Ikaria, Greece. One of every three inhabitants of this island near the coast of 
Turkey is over ninety years old (compared to less than 1 percent of the 
population of the United States), a fact that has earned it the nickname the 
Island of Long Life. The local secret seems to be a lifestyle that dates back to 
500 BC. 

In the following chapters, we will examine several factors that seem to be the 
keys to longevity and are found across the Blue Zones, paying special attention to 
Okinawa and its so-called Village of Longevity. First, however, it is worth 
pointing out that three of these regions are islands, where resources can be scarce 
and communities have to help one another. 

For many, helping others might be an ikigai strong enough to keep them alive. 

According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to 
longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming 
strong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family 
relations. 

Members of these communities manage their time well in order to reduce 
stress, consume little meat or processed foods, and drink alcohol in moderation.- 

They don’t do strenuous exercise, but they do move every day, taking walks 
and working in their vegetable gardens. People in the Blue Zones would rather 
walk than drive. Gardening, which involves daily low-intensity movement, is a 
practice almost all of them have in common. 


The 80 percent secret 

One of the most common sayings in Japan is “Hara hachi bu,” which is repeated 
before or after eating and means something like “Fill your belly to 80 percent.” 
Ancient wisdom advises against eating until we are full. This is why Okinawans 
stop eating when they feel their stomachs reach 80 percent of their capacity, 
rather than overeating and wearing down their bodies with long digestive 
processes that accelerate cellular oxidation. 

Of course, there is no way to know objectively if your stomach is at 80 
percent capacity. The lesson to leam from this saying is that we should stop eating 
when we are starting to feel full. The extra side dish, the snack we eat when we 
know in our hearts we don’t really need it, the apple pie after lunch—all these will 


give us pleasure in the short term, but not having them will make us happier in 
the long term. 

The way food is served is also important. By presenting their meals on many 
small plates, the Japanese tend to eat less. A typical meal in a restaurant in Japan 
is served in five plates on a tray, four of them very small and the main dish 
slightly bigger. Having five plates in front of you makes it seem like you are 
going to eat a lot, but what happens most of the time is that you end up feeling 
slightly hungry. This is one of the reasons why Westerners in Japan typically lose 
weight and stay trim. 

Recent studies by nutritionists reveal that Okinawans consume a daily average 
of 1,800 to 1,900 calories, compared to 2,200 to 3,300 in the United States, and 
have a body mass index between 18 and 22, compared to 26 or 27 in the United 
States. 

The Okinawan diet is rich in tofu, sweet potatoes, fish (three times per week), 
and vegetables (roughly 11 ounces per day). In the chapter dedicated to nutrition 
we will see which healthy, antioxidant-rich foods are included in this 80 percent. 


Moai: Connected for life 

It is customary in Okinawa to form close bonds within local communities. A moai 
is an informal group of people with common interests who look out for one 
another. For many, serving the community becomes part of their ikigai. 

The moai has its origins in hard times, when farmers would get together to 
share best practices and help one another cope with meager harvests. 

Members of a moai make a set monthly contribution to the group. This 
payment allows them to participate in meetings, dinners, games of go and shogi 
(Japanese chess), or whatever hobby they have in common. 

The funds collected by the group are used for activities, but if there is money 
left over, one member (decided on a rotating basis) receives a set amount from 
the surplus. In this way, being part of a moai helps maintain emotional and 
financial stability. If a member of a moai is in financial trouble, he or she can get 
an advance from the group’s savings. While the details of each moai ’s accounting 
practices vary according to the group and its economic means, the feeling of 
belonging and support gives the individual a sense of security and helps increase 
life expectancy.

Following this brief introduction to the topics covered in this book, we look at 
a few causes of premature aging in modern life, and then explore different 
factors related to ikigai. 



II 

ANTIAGING SECRETS 

Little things that add up to a long 
and happy life 



Aging’s escape velocity 

For more than a century, we’ve managed to add an average of 0.3 years to our life 
expectancy every year. But what would happen if we had the technology to add a 
year of life expectancy every year? In theory, we would achieve biological 
immortality, having reached aging’s “escape velocity.” 



you advance closer to the sign. When you reach the sign, you die. 

Now imagine a rabbit holding the sign and walking to the future. Every 
year that you live, the rabbit is half a year as far away. After a while, you 
will reach the rabbit and die. 

But what if the rabbit could walk at a pace of one year for every year 
of your life? You would never be able to catch the rabbit, and therefore 
you would never die. 

The speed at which the rabbit walks to the future is our technology. 

The more we advance technology and knowledge of our bodies, the faster 
we can make the rabbit walk. 

Aging’s escape velocity is the moment at which the rabbit walks at a 
pace of one year per year or faster, and we become immortal. 


Researchers with an eye to the future, such as Ray Kurzweil and Aubrey de 
Grey, claim that we’ll reach this escape velocity in a matter of decades. Other 
scientists are less optimistic, predicting that we’ll reach a limit, a maximum age 
we won’t be able to surpass, no matter how much technology we have. For 
example, some biologists assert that our cells stop regenerating after about 120 
years. 


Active mind, youthful body 



There is much wisdom in the classic saying “mens sana in corpore sano” (“a 
sound mind in a sound body”): It reminds us that both mind and body are 
important, and that the health of one is connected to that of the other. It has been 
shown that maintaining an active, adaptable mind is one of the key factors in 
staying young. 

Having a youthful mind also drives you toward a healthy lifestyle that will 
slow the aging process. 

Just as a lack of physical exercise has negative effects on our bodies and 
mood, a lack of mental exercise is bad for us because it causes our neurons and 
neural connections to deteriorate—and, as a result, reduces our ability to react to 
our surroundings. 

This is why it’s so important to give your brain a workout. 

One pioneer in advocating for mental exercise is the Israeli neuroscientist 
Shlomo Breznitz, who argues that the brain needs a lot of stimulation in order to 
stay in shape. As he stated in an interview with Eduard Punset for the Spanish 
television program Redes: 


There is a tension between what is good for someone and what they want to do. This is because people, 
especially older people, like to do things as they’ve always done them. The problem is that when the 
brain develops ingrained habits, it doesn’t need to think anymore. Things get done quickly and 
efficiently on automatic pilot, often in a very advantageous way. This creates a tendency to stick to 
routines, and the only way of breaking these is to confront the brain with new information.- 

Presented with new information, the brain creates new connections and is 
revitalized. This is why it is so important to expose yourself to change, even if 
stepping outside your comfort zone means feeling a bit of anxiety. 

The effects of mental training have been scientifically demonstrated. 
According to Collins Hemingway and Shlomo Breznitz in their book Maximum 
Brainpower: Challenging the Brain for Health and Wisdom, mental training is 
beneficial on many levels: “You begin exercising your brain by doing a certain 
task for the first time,” he writes. “And at first it seems very difficult, but as you 
leam how to do it, the training is already working. The second time, you realize 
that it’s easier, not harder, to do, because you’re getting better at it. This has a 
fantastic effect on a person’s mood. In and of itself, it is a transformation that 
affects not only the results obtained, but also his or her self-image.” 

This description of a “mental workout” might sound a bit formal, but simply 
interacting with others—playing a game, for example—offers new stimuli and 
helps prevent the depression that can come with solitude. 

Our neurons start to age while we are still in our twenties. This process is 


slowed, however, by intellectual activity, curiosity, and a desire to learn. Dealing 
with new situations, learning something new every day, playing games, and 
interacting with other people seem to be essential antiaging strategies for the 
mind. Furthermore, a more positive outlook in this regard will yield greater 
mental benefits. 


Stress: Accused of killing longevity 

Many people seem older than they are. Research into the causes of premature 
aging has shown that stress has a lot to do with it, because the body wears down 
much faster during periods of crisis. The American Institute of Stress 
investigated this degenerative process and concluded that most health problems 
are caused by stress. 

Researchers at the Heidelberg University Hospital conducted a study in which 
they subjected a young doctor to a job interview, which they made even more 
stressful by forcing him to solve complex math problems for thirty minutes. 
Afterward, they took a blood sample. What they discovered was that his 
antibodies had reacted to stress the same way they react to pathogens, activating 
the proteins that trigger an immune response. The problem is that this response 
not only neutralizes harmful agents, it also damages healthy cells, leading them to 
age prematurely. 

The University of California conducted a similar study, taking data and 
samples from thirty-nine women who had high levels of stress due to the illness 
of one of their children and comparing them to samples from women with 
healthy children and low levels of stress. They found that stress promotes cellular 
aging by weakening cell structures known as telomeres, which affect cellular 
regeneration and how our cells age. As the study revealed, the greater the stress, 
the greater the degenerative effect on cells. 


How does stress work? 

These days, people live at a frantic pace and in a nearly constant state of 
competition. At this fever pitch, stress is a natural response to the information 
being received by the body as potentially dangerous or problematic. 
Theoretically, this is a useful reaction, as it helps us survive in hostile

deal with difficult situations and to flee from predators. 

The alarm that goes off in our head makes our neurons activate the pituitary 
gland, which produces hormones that release corticotropin, which in turn 
circulates through the body via the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal 
gland is then triggered to release adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline raises our 
respiratory rate and pulse and prepares our muscles for action, getting the body 
ready to react to perceived danger, while cortisol increases the release of 
dopamine and blood glucose, which is what gets us “charged up” and allows us to 
face challenges. 


Cave Dwellers 

Modern Humans 

Were relaxed most of the time. 

Work most of the time and are alert to any and all threats. 

Felt stress only in very specific 
situations. 

Are online or waiting for notifications from their cell phones twenty-four hours a 
day. 

The threats were real: A predator could 
end their lives at any moment. 

The brain associates the ping of a cell phone or an e-mail notification with the 
threat of a predator. 

High doses of cortisol and adrenaline at 
moments of danger kept the body 
healthy. 

Low doses of cortisol flow constantly through the body, with implications for a 
range of health problems, including adrenal fatigue and chronic fatigue 
syndrome. 


These processes are, in moderation, beneficial—they help us overcome 
challenges in our daily lives. Nonetheless, the stress to which human beings are 
subjected today is clearly harmful. 

Stress has a degenerative effect over time. A sustained state of emergency 
affects the neurons associated with memory, as well as inhibiting the release of 
certain hormones, the absence of which can cause depression. Its secondary 
effects include irritability, insomnia, anxiety, and high blood pressure. 

As such, though challenges are good for keeping mind and body active, we 
should adjust our high-stress lifestyles in order to avoid the premature aging of 
our bodies. 


Be mindful about reducing stress 

Whether or not the threats we perceive are real, stress is an easily identifiable 
condition that not only causes anxiety but is also highly psychosomatic, affecting 
everything from our digestive system to our skin. 






This is why prevention is so important in avoiding the toll that stress takes on 
us—and why many experts recommend practicing mindfulness. 

The central premise of this stress-reduction method is focusing on the self: 
noticing our responses, even if they are conditioned by habit, in order to be fully 
conscious of them. In this way, we connect with the here and now and limit 
thoughts that tend to spiral out of control. 

“We have to leam to turn off the autopilot that’s steering us in an endless loop. 
We all know people who snack while talking on the phone or watching the news. 
You ask them if the omelet they just ate had onion in it, and they can’t tell you,” 
says Roberto Alcibar, who abandoned his fast-paced life to become a certified 
instructor of mindfulness after an illness threw him into a period of acute stress. 

One way to reach a state of mindfulness is through meditation, which helps 
filter the information that reaches us from the outside world. It can also be 
achieved through breathing exercises, yoga, and body scans. 

Achieving mindfulness involves a gradual process of training, but with a bit of 
practice we can learn to focus our mind completely, which reduces stress and 
helps us live longer. 


A little stress is good for you 

While sustained, intense stress is a known enemy of longevity and both mental 
and physical health, low levels of stress have been shown to be beneficial. 

After observing a group of test subjects for more than twenty years, Dr. 
Howard S. Friedman, a psychology professor at the University of California, 
Riverside, discovered that people who maintained a low level of stress, who faced 
challenges and put their heart and soul into their work in order to succeed, lived 
longer than those who chose a more relaxed lifestyle and retired earlier. From 
this, he concluded that a small dose of stress is a positive thing, as those who live 
with low levels of stress tend to develop healthier habits, smoke less, and drink 
less alcohol.- 

Given this, it is not surprising that many of the supercentenarians—people 
who live to be 110 or more—whom we’ll meet in this book talk about having 
lived intense lives and working well into old age. 


A lot of sitting will age you 


In the Western world in particular, the rise in sedentary behavior has led to 
numerous diseases such as hypertension and obesity, which in turn affect 
longevity. 

Spending too much time seated at work or at home not only reduces muscular 
and respiratory fitness but also increases appetite and curbs the desire to 
participate in activities. Being sedentary can lead to hypertension, imbalanced 
eating, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and even certain kinds of cancer. 
Recent studies have shown a connection between a lack of physical activity and 
the progressive distortion of telomeres in the immune system, which ages those 
cells and, in turn, the organism as a whole. 

This is a problem at all life stages, not only among adults. Sedentary children 
suffer from high rates of obesity and all its associated health issues and risks, 
which is why it’s so important to develop a healthy and active lifestyle at an early 
age. 

It’s easy to be less sedentary; it just takes a bit of effort and a few changes to 
your routine. We can access a more active lifestyle that makes us feel better 
inside and out—we just have to add a few ingredients to our everyday habits: 

■ Walk to work, or just go on a walk for at least twenty minutes each day. 

■ Use your feet instead of an elevator or escalator. This is good for your 
posture, your muscles, and your respiratory system, among other things. 

■ Participate in social or leisure activities so that you don’t spend too much time 
in front of the television. 

■ Replace your junk food with fruit and you’ll have less of an urge to snack, 
and more nutrients in your system. 

■ Get the right amount of sleep. Seven to nine hours is good, but any more than 
that makes us lethargic. 

■ Play with children or pets, or join a sports team. This not only strengthens the 
body but also stimulates the mind and boosts self-esteem. 

■ Be conscious of your daily routine in order to detect harmful habits and 
replace them with more positive ones. 

By making these small changes, we can begin to renew our bodies and minds 
and increase our life expectancy.

Though we age both externally and internally, both physically and mentally, one 
of the things that tell us the most about people’s age is their skin, which takes on 
different textures and colors according to processes going on beneath the surface. 
Most of those who make their living as models claim to sleep between nine and 
ten hours the night before a fashion show. This gives their skin a taut, wrinkle- 
free appearance and a healthy, radiant glow. 

Science has shown that sleep is a key antiaging tool, because when we sleep 
we generate melatonin, a hormone that occurs naturally in our bodies. The pineal 
gland produces it from the neurotransmitter serotonin according to our diurnal 
and nocturnal rhythms, and it plays a role in our sleep and waking cycles. 

A powerful antioxidant, melatonin helps us live longer, and also offers the 
following benefits: 

■ It strengthens the immune system. 

■ It contains an element that protects against cancer. 

■ It promotes the natural production of insulin. 

■ It slows the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. 

■ It helps prevent osteoporosis and fight heart disease. 

For all these reasons, melatonin is a great ally in preserving youth. It should be 
noted, however, that melatonin production decreases after age thirty. We can 
compensate for this by: 

■ Eating a balanced diet and getting more calcium. 

■ Soaking up a moderate amount of sun each day. 

■ Getting enough sleep. 

■ Avoiding stress, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, all of which make it harder 
to get a good night’s rest, depriving us of the melatonin we need. 

Experts are trying to determine whether artificially stimulating production of 
melatonin might help slow the aging process . . . which would confirm the theory 
that we already carry the secret to longevity within us. 


Antiaging attitudes 


The mind has tremendous power over the body and how quickly it ages. Most 
doctors agree that the secret to keeping the body young is keeping the mind active 
—a key element of ikigai —and in not caving in when we face difficulties 
throughout our lives. 

One study, conducted at Yeshiva University, found that the people who live 
the longest have two dispositional traits in common: a positive attitude and a high 
degree of emotional awareness. In other words, those who face challenges with a 
positive outlook and are able to manage their emotions are already well on their 
way toward longevity. 

A stoic attitude —serenity in the face of a setback—can also help keep you 
young, as it lowers anxiety and stress levels and stabilizes behavior. This can be 
seen in the greater life expectancies of certain cultures with unhurried, deliberate 
lifestyles. 

Many centenarians and supercentenarians have similar profiles: They have had 
full lives that were difficult at times, but they knew how to approach these 
challenges with a positive attitude and not be overwhelmed by the obstacles they 
faced. 

Alexander Imich, who in 2014 became the world’s oldest living man at age 
111, knew he had good genes but understood that other factors contributed, too: 
“The life you live is equally or more important for longevity,” he said in an 
interview with Reuters after being added to Guinness World Records in 2014. 


An ode to longevity 

During our stay in Ogimi, the village that holds the Guinness record for longevity, 
a woman who was about to turn 100 years old sang the following song for us in a 
mixture of Japanese and the local dialect: 

To keep healthy and have a long life, 

eat just a little of everything with relish, 

go to bed early, get up early, and then go out for a walk. 

We live each day with serenity and we enjoy the journey. 

To keep healthy and have a long life, 
we get on well with all of our friends. 

Spring, summer, fall, winter, 
we happily enjoy all the seasons.

We can now use our fingers to turn the page to the next chapter, where we will 
look at the close relationship between longevity and discovering our life’s 
mission. 


FROM LOGOTHERAPY TO IKIGAI 

How to live longer and better by 
finding your purpose 



What is logotherapy? 

A colleague once asked Viktor Frankl to define his school of psychology in a 
single phrase, to which Frankl replied, “Well, in logotherapy the patient sits up 
straight and has to listen to things that are, on occasion, hard to hear.” The 
colleague had just described psychoanalysis to him in the following terms: “In 
psychoanalysis, the patient lies down on a couch and tells you things that are, on 
occasion, hard to say.” 

Frankl explains that one of the first questions he would ask his patients was 
“Why do you not commit suicide?” Usually the patient found good reasons not to, 
and was able to carry on. What, then, does logotherapy do? - 

The answer is pretty clear: It helps you find reasons to live. 

Logotherapy pushes patients to consciously discover their life’s purpose in 
order to confront their neuroses. Their quest to fulfill their destiny then motivates 
them to press forward, breaking the mental chains of the past and overcoming 
whatever obstacles they encounter along the way. 


Something to Live For 

A study conducted by Frankl in his Vienna clinic found that among both 
patients and personnel, around 80 percent believed that human beings 
needed a reason for living, and around 60 percent felt they had someone 
or something in their lives worth dying for- 


The search for meaning 

The search for purpose became a personal, driving force that allowed Frankl to 
achieve his goals. The process of logotherapy can be summarized in these five 
steps: 



1. A person feels empty, frustrated, or anxious. 

2. The therapist shows him that what he is feeling is the desire to have a 
meaningful life. 

3. The patient discovers his life’s purpose (at that particular point in time). 

4. Of his own free will, the patient decides to accept or reject that destiny. 

5. This newfound passion for life helps him overcome obstacles and sorrows. 

Frankl himself would live and die for his principles and ideals. His 
experiences as a prisoner at Auschwitz showed him that “Everything can be taken 
from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s 
attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”- It was 
something he had to go through alone, without any help, and it inspired him for 
the rest of his life. 


Ten Differences Between Psychoanalysis and Logotherapy 

Psychoanalysis 

Logotherapy 

The patient reclines on a couch, like a patient. 

The patient sits facing the therapist, who guides him or her without 
passing judgment. 

Is retrospective: It looks to the past. 

Looks toward the future. 

Is introspective: It analyzes neuroses. 

Does not delve into the patient’s neuroses. 

The drive is toward pleasure. 

The drive is toward purpose and meaning. 

Centers on psychology. 

Includes a spiritual dimension. 

Works on psychogenic neuroses. 

Also works on noogenic, or existential, neuroses. 

Analyzes the unconscious origin of conflicts 
(instinctual dimension). 

Deals with conflicts when and where they arise (spiritual 
dimension). 

Limits itself to the patient’s instincts. 

Also deals with spiritual realities. 

Is fundamentally incompatible with faith. 

Is compatible with faith. 

Seeks to reconcile conflicts and satisfy impulses and 
instincts. 

Seeks to help the patient find meaning in his life and satisfy his 
moral principles. 


Fight for yourself 

Existential frustration arises when our life is without purpose, or when that 
purpose is skewed. In Frankl’s view, however, there is no need to see this 
frustration as an anomaly or a symptom of neurosis; instead, it can be a positive 




thing—a catalyst tor change. 

Logotherapy does not see this frustration as mental illness, the way other forms 
of therapy do, but rather as spiritual anguish —a natural and beneficial 
phenomenon that drives those who suffer from it to seek a cure, whether on their 
own or with the help of others, and in so doing to find greater satisfaction in life. 
It helps them change their own destiny. 

Logotherapy enters the picture if the person needs help doing this, if he needs 
guidance in discovering his life’s purpose and later in overcoming conflicts so he 
can keep moving toward his objective. In Man’s Search for Meaning, Frankl cites 
one of Nietzsche’s famous aphorisms: “He who has a why to live for can bear 
with almost any how.” 

Based on his own experience, Frankl believed that our health depends on that 
natural tension that comes from comparing what we’ve accomplished so far with 
what we’d like to achieve in the future. What we need, then, is not a peaceful 
existence, but a challenge we can strive to meet by applying all the skills at our 
disposal. 

Existential crisis, on the other hand, is typical of modern societies in which 
people do what they are told to do, or what others do, rather than what they want 
to do. They often try to fill the gap between what is expected of them and what 
they want for themselves with economic power or physical pleasure, or by 
numbing their senses. It can even lead to suicide. 

Sunday neurosis, for example, is what happens when, without the obligations 
and commitments of the workweek, the individual realizes how empty he is 
inside. He has to find a solution. Above all, he has to find his purpose, his reason 
for getting out of bed—his ikigai. 


“I Feel Empty Inside” 

In a study conducted at the Vienna Polyclinic Hospital, Frankl’s team 
found that 55 percent of the patients they interviewed were experiencing 
some degree of existential crisis.- 


According to logotherapy, discovering one’s purpose in life helps an individual 
fill that existential void. Frankl, a man who faced his problems and turned his 
objectives into actions, could look back on his life in peace as he grew old. He 



did not have to envy those still enjoying their youth, because he had amassed a 
broad set of experiences that showed he had lived for something. 


Better living through logotherapy: A few key ideas 

■ We don’t create the meaning of our life, as Sartre claimed—we discover it. 

■ We each have a unique reason for being, which can be adjusted or 
transformed many times over the years. 

■ Just as worry often brings about precisely the thing that was feared, 
excessive attention to a desire (or “hyper-intention”) can keep that desire 
from being fulfilled. 

■ Humor can help break negative cycles and reduce anxiety. 

■ We all have the capacity to do noble or terrible things. The side of the 
equation we end up on depends on our decisions, not on the condition in 
which we find ourselves. 

In the pages that follow, we will look at four cases from Frankl’s own practice 
in order to better understand the search for meaning and purpose. 


Case study: Viktor Frankl 

In German concentration camps, as in those that would later be built in Japan and 
Korea, psychiatrists confirmed that the prisoners with the greatest chance of 
survival were those who had things they wanted to accomplish outside the camp, 
those who felt a strong need to get out of there alive. This was true of Frankl, 
who, after being released and successfully developing the school of logotherapy, 
realized he had been the first patient of his own practice. 

Frankl had a goal to achieve, and it made him persevere. He arrived at 
Auschwitz carrying a manuscript that contained all the theories and research he 
had compiled over the course of his career, ready for publication. When it was 
confiscated, he felt compelled to write it all over again, and that need drove him 
and gave his life meaning amid the constant horror and doubt of the 
concentration camp—so much so that over the years, and especially when he fell 
ill with typhus, he would jot down fragments and key words from the lost work 
on any scrap of paper he found. 


Case study: The American diplomat 

An important North American diplomat went to Frankl to pick up where he left 
off with a course of treatment he had started five years earlier in the United 
States. When Frankl asked him why he’d started therapy in the first place, the 
diplomat answered that he hated his job and his country’s international policies, 
which he had to follow and enforce. His American psychoanalyst, whom he’d 
been seeing for years, insisted he make peace with his father so that his 
government and his job, both representations of the paternal figure, would seem 
less disagreeable. Frankl, however, showed him in just a few sessions that his 
frustration was due to the fact that he wanted to pursue a different career, and the 
diplomat concluded his treatment with that idea in mind. 

Five years later, the former diplomat informed Frankl that he had been 
working during that time in a different profession, and that he was happy. 

In Frankl’s view, the man not only didn’t need all those years of 
psychoanalysis, he also couldn’t even really be considered a “patient” in need of 
therapy. He was simply someone in search of a new life’s purpose; as soon as he 
found it, his life took on deeper meaning. 


Case study: The suicidal mother 

The mother of a boy who had died at age eleven was admitted to Frankl’s clinic 
after she tried to kill herself and her other son. It was this other son, paralyzed 
since birth, who kept her from carrying out her plan: He did believe his life had a 
purpose, and if his mother killed them both, it would keep him from achieving 
his goals. 

The woman shared her story in a group session. To help her, Frankl asked 
another woman to imagine a hypothetical situation in which she lay on her 
deathbed, old and wealthy but childless. The woman insisted that, in that case, she 
would have felt her life had been a failure. 

When the suicidal mother was asked to perform the same exercise, imagining 
herself on her deathbed, she looked back and realized that she had done 
everything in her power for her children—for both of them. She had given her 
paralyzed son a good life, and he had turned into a kind, reasonably happy person. 
To this she added, crying, “As for myself, I can look back peacefully on my life; 
for I can say my life was full of meaning, and I have tried hard to live it fully; I 
have done mv best—I have done mv best for mv son. Mv life was no failure!” 


In this way, by imagining herself on her deathbed and looking back, the 
suicidal mother found the meaning that, though she was not aware of it, her life 
already had. 


Case study: The grief-stricken doctor 

An elderly doctor, unable to overcome the deep depression into which he’d fallen 
after the death of his wife two years earlier, went to Frankl for help. 

Instead of giving him advice or analyzing his condition, Frankl asked him 
what would have happened if he had been the one who died first. The doctor, 
horrified, answered that it would have been terrible for his poor wife, that she 
would have suffered tremendously. To which Frankl responded, “You see, 
doctor? You have spared her all that suffering, but the price you have to pay for 
this is to survive, and mourn her.” 

The doctor didn’t say another word. He left Frankl’s office in peace, after 
taking the therapist’s hand in his own. He was able to tolerate the pain in place of 
his beloved wife. His life had been given a purpose. 


Morita therapy 

In the same decade that logotherapy came into being—a few years earlier, in fact 
—Shoma Morita created his own purpose-centered therapy, in Japan. It proved to 
be effective in the treatment of neurosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 
posttraumatic stress. 

In addition to being a psychotherapist, Shoma Morita was a Zen Buddhist, and 
his therapy left a lasting spiritual mark on Japan. 

Many Western forms of therapy focus on controlling or modifying the 
patient’s emotions. In the West, we tend to believe that what we think influences 
how we feel, which in turn influences how we act. In contrast, Morita therapy 
focuses on teaching patients to accept their emotions without trying to control them , 
since their feelings will change as a result of their actions. 

In addition to accepting the patient’s emotions, Morita therapy seeks to 
“create” new emotions on the basis of actions. According to Morita, these 
emotions are learned through experience and repetition. 


Morita therapy is not meant to eliminate symptoms; instead it teaches us to 
accept our desires, anxieties, fears, and worries, and let them go. As Morita 
writes in his book Morita Therapy and the True Nature of Anxiety-Based 
Disorders, “In feelings, it is best to be wealthy and generous.” 

Morita explained the idea of letting go of negative feelings with the following 
fable: A donkey that is tied to a post by a rope will keep walking around the post 
in an attempt to free itself, only to become more immobilized and attached to the 
post. The same thing applies to people with obsessive thinking who become more 
trapped in their own suffering when they try to escape from their fears and 
discomfort.- 

The basic principles of Morita therapy 

1. Accept your feelings. If we have obsessive thoughts, we should not try to 
control them or get rid of them. If we do, they become more intense. Regarding 
human emotions, the Zen master would say, “If we try to get rid of one wave with 
another, we end up with an infinite sea.” We don’t create our feelings; they 
simply come to us, and we have to accept them. The trick is welcoming them. 
Morita likened emotions to the weather: We can’t predict or control them; we can 
only observe them. To this point, he often quoted the Vietnamese monk Thich 
Nhat Hanh, who would say, “Hello, solitude. How are you today? Come, sit with 
me, and I will care for you.”- 

2. Do what you should be doing. We shouldn’t focus on eliminating symptoms, 
because recovery will come on its own. We should focus instead on the present 
moment, and if we are suffering, on accepting that suffering. Above all, we 
should avoid intellectualizing the situation. The therapist’s mission is to develop 
the patient’s character so he or she can face any situation, and character is 
grounded in the things we do. Morita therapy does not offer its patients 
explanations, but rather allows them to learn from their actions and activities. It 
doesn’t tell you how to meditate, or how to keep a diary the way Western 
therapies do. It is up to the patient to make discoveries through experience. 

3. Discover your life’s purpose. We can’t control our emotions, but we can take 
charge of our actions every day. This is why we should have a clear sense of our 
purpose, and always keep Morita’s mantra in mind: “What do we need to be doing 
right now? What action should we be taking?” The key to achieving this is having 
dared to look inside yourself to find your ikigai. 


The four phases of Morita therapy 

Morita’s original treatment, which lasts fifteen to twenty-one days, consists of the 
following stages: 

1. Isolation and rest (five to seven days). During the first week of treatment, 
the patient rests in a room without any external stimuli. No television, books, 
family, friends, or speaking. All the patient has is his thoughts. He lies down for 
most of the day and is visited regularly by the therapist, who tries to avoid 
interacting with him as much as possible. The therapist simply advises the patient 
to continue observing the rise and fall of his emotions as he lies there. When the 
patient gets bored and wants to start doing things again, he is ready to move on to 
the next stage of therapy. 

2. Light occupational therapy (five to seven days). In this stage, the patient 
performs repetitive tasks in silence. One of these is keeping a diary about his 
thoughts and feelings. The patient goes outside after a week of being shut in, 
takes walks in nature, and does breathing exercises. He also starts doing simple 
activities, such as gardening, drawing, or painting. During this stage, the patient is 
still not allowed to talk to anyone, except the therapist. 

3. Occupational therapy (five to seven days). In this stage, the patient performs 
tasks that require physical movement. Dr. Morita liked to take his patients to the 
mountains to chop wood. In addition to physical tasks, the patient is also 
immersed in other activities, such as writing, painting, or making ceramics. The 
patient can speak with others at this stage, but only about the tasks at hand. 

4. The return to social life and the “real” world. The patient leaves the hospital 
and is reintroduced to social life, but maintains the practices of meditation and 
occupational therapy developed during treatment. The idea is to reenter society as 
a new person, with a sense of purpose, and without being controlled by social or 
emotional pressures. 


Naikan meditation 

Morita was a great Zen master of Naikan introspective meditation. Much of his 
therapy draws on his knowledge and mastery of this school, which centers on 
three questions the individual must ask him-or herself: 


1. What have I received from person X? 

2. What have I given to person X? 

3. What problems have I caused person X? 

Through these reflections, we stop identifying others as the cause of our 
problems and deepen our own sense of responsibility. As Morita said, “If you are 
angry and want to fight, think about it for three days before coming to blows. 
After three days, the intense desire to fight will pass on its own.”- 


And now, ikigai 

Logotherapy and Morita therapy are both grounded in a personal, unique 
experience that you can access without therapists or spiritual retreats: the mission 
of finding your ikigai, your existential fuel. Once you find it, it is only a matter of 
having the courage and making the effort to stay on the right path. 

In the following chapters, we’ll take a look at the basic tools you’ll need to get 
moving along that path: finding flow in the tasks you’ve chosen to do, eating in a 
balanced and mindful way, doing low-intensity exercise, and learning not to give 
in when difficulties arise. In order to do this, you have to accept that the world— 
like the people who live in it—is imperfect, but that it is still full of opportunities 
for growth and achievement. 

Are you ready to throw yourself into your passion as if it were the most 
important thing in the world? 



FIND FLOW IN EVERYTHING YOU DO 

How to turn work and free time 
into spaces for growth 



We are what we repeatedly do. 

Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. 

—Aristotle 


Going with the flow 

Imagine you are skiing down one of your favorite slopes. Powdery snow flies up 
on both sides of you like white sand. Conditions are perfect. 

You are entirely focused on skiing as well as you can. You know exactly how 
to move at each moment. There is no future, no past. There is only the present. 

You feel the snow, your skis, your body, and your consciousness united as a 
single entity. You are completely immersed in the experience, not thinking about or 
distracted by anything else. Your ego dissolves, and you become part of what you 
are doing. 

This is the kind of experience Bruce Lee described with his famous “Be water, 
my friend.” 

We’ve all felt our sense of time vanish when we lose ourselves in an activity 
we enjoy. We start cooking and before we know it, several hours have passed. 

We spend an afternoon with a book and forget about the world going by until we 
notice the sunset and realize we haven’t eaten dinner. We go surfing and don’t 
realize how many hours we have spent in the water until the next day, when our 
muscles ache. 

The opposite can also happen. When we have to complete a task we don’t want 
to do, every minute feels like a lifetime and we can’t stop looking at our watch. 

As the quip attributed to Einstein goes, “Put your hand on a hot stove for a 
minute and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems 
like a minute. That is relativity.” 

The funny thing is that someone else might really enjoy the same task, but we 
want to finish as quickly as possible. 

What makes us enjoy doing something so much that we forget about whatever 
worries we might have while we do it? When are we happiest? These questions 
can help us discover our ikigai. 


The power of flow 

These questions are also at the heart of psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s 
research into the experience of being completely immersed in what we are doing. 
Csikszentmihalyi called this state “flow,” and described it as the pleasure, delight, 
creativity, and process when we are completely immersed in life. 

There is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your 
ikigai, but one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through 
this state, to have an “optimal experience.” 

In order to achieve this optimal experience, we have to focus on increasing the 
time we spend on activities that bring us to this state of flow, rather than allowing 
ourselves to get caught up in activities that offer immediate pleasure—like eating 
too much, abusing drugs or alcohol, or stuffing ourselves with chocolate in front 
of the TV. 

As Csikszentmihalyi asserts in his book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal 
Experience, flow is “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that 
nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will 
do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.” 

It is not only creative professionals who require the high doses of 
concentration that promote flow. Most athletes, chess players, and engineers also 
spend much of their time on activities that bring them to this state. 

According to Csikszentmihalyi’s research, a chess player feels the same way 
upon entering a state of flow as a mathematician working on a formula or a 
surgeon performing an operation. A professor of psychology, Csikszentmihalyi 
analyzed data from people around the world and discovered that flow is the same 
among individuals of all ages and cultures. In New York and Okinawa, we all 
reach a state of flow in the same way. 

But what happens to our mind when we are in that state? 

When we flow, we are focused on a concrete task without any distractions. 

Our mind is “in order.” The opposite occurs when we try to do something while 
our mind is on other things. 

If you often find yourself losing focus while working on something you 
consider important, there are several strategies you can employ to increase your 
chances of achieving flow.

requirements for achieving flow are: 

1. Knowing what to do 

2. Knowing how to do it 

3. Knowing how well you are doing 

4. Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved) 

5. Perceiving significant challenges 

6. Perceiving significant skills 

7. Being free from distractions- 


Strategy 1: Choose a difficult task (but not too 
difficult!) 

Schaffer’s model encourages us to take on tasks that we have a chance of 
completing but that are slightly outside our comfort zone. 

Every task, sport, or job has a set of rules, and we need a set of skills to follow 
them. If the rules for completing a task or achieving a purpose are too basic 
relative to our skill set, we will likely get bored. Activities that are too easy lead 
to apathy. 

If, on the other hand, we assign ourselves a task that is too difficult, we won’t 
have the skills to complete it and will almost certainly give up—and feel 
frustrated, to boot. 

The ideal is to find a middle path, something aligned with our abilities but just 
a bit of a stretch, so we experience it as a challenge. This is what Ernest 
Hemingway meant when he said, “Sometimes I write better than I can.’ - 

We want to see challenges through to the end because we enjoy the feeling of 
pushing ourselves. Bertrand Russell expressed a similar idea when he said, “To be 
able to concentrate for a considerable amount of time is essential to difficult 
achievement.”- 

If you’re a graphic designer, learn a new software program for your next 
project. If you’re a programmer, use a new programming language. If you’re a 
dancer, try to incorporate into your next routine a movement that has seemed 
impossible for years. 

Add a little something extra, something that takes you out of your comfort 



zone. 


Even doing something as simple as reading means following certain rules, 
having certain abilities and knowledge. If we set out to read a book on quantum 
mechanics for specialists in physics without being specialists in physics ourselves, 
we’ll probably give up after a few minutes. On the other end of the spectrum, if 
we already know everything a book has to tell us, we’ll get bored right away. 

However, if the book is appropriate to our knowledge and abilities, and builds 
on what we already know, we’ll immerse ourselves in our reading, and time will 
flow. This pleasure and satisfaction are evidence that we are in tune with our 
ikigai.

Beyond Our Abilities

Strategy 2: Have a clear, concrete objective 

Video games—played in moderation—board games, and sports are great ways to 
achieve flow, because the objective tends to be very clear: Beat your rival or your 
own record while following a set of explicitly defined rules. 

Unfortunately, the objective isn’t quite as clear in most situations. 

According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, when asked about their 
bosses, the number one complaint of employees at multinational corporations is 
that they don’t “communicate the team’s mission clearly,” and that, as a result, the 
employees don’t know what their objectives are. 

What often happens, especially in big companies, is that the executives get lost 
in the details of obsessive planning, creating strategies to hide the fact that they 
don’t have a clear objective. It’s like heading out to sea with a map but no 
destination. 

It is much more important to have a compass pointing to a concrete objective 
than to have a map. Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, encourages us to use 
the principle of “compass over maps” as a tool to navigate our world of 
uncertainty. In the book Whiplash: How to Survive Our Faster Future , he and Jeff 
Howe write, “In an increasingly unpredictable world moving ever more quickly, a 
detailed map may lead you deep into the woods at an unnecessarily high cost. A 
good compass, though, will always take you where you need to go. It doesn’t 
mean that you should start your journey without any idea where you’re going. 








What it does mean is understanding that while the path to your goal may not be 
straight, you’ll finish faster and more efficiently than you would have if you had 
trudged along a preplanned route.” 

In business, the creative professions, and education alike, it’s important to 
reflect on what we hope to achieve before starting to work, study, or make 
something. We should ask ourselves questions such as: 

■ What is my objective for today’s session in the studio? 

■ How many words am I going to write today for the article coming out next 
month? 

■ What is my team’s mission? 

■ How fast will I set the metronome tomorrow in order to play that sonata at 
an allegro tempo by the end of the week? 

Having a clear objective is important in achieving flow, but we also have to 
know how to leave it behind when we get down to business. Once the journey has 
begun, we should keep this objective in mind without obsessing over it. 

When Olympic athletes compete for a gold medal, they can’t stop to think how 
pretty the medal is. They have to be present in the moment—they have t o flow. If 
they lose focus for a second, thinking how proud they’ll be to show the medal to 
their parents, they’ll almost certainly commit an error at a critical moment and 
will not win the competition. 

One common example of this is writer’s block. Imagine that a writer has to 
finish a novel in three months. The objective is clear; the problem is that the 
writer can’t stop obsessing over it. Every day she wakes up thinking, “I have to 
write that novel,” and every day she sets about reading the newspaper and 
cleaning the house. Every evening she feels frustrated and promises she’ll get to 
work the next day. 

Days, weeks, and months pass, and the writer still hasn’t gotten anything down 
on the page, when all it would have taken was to sit down and get that first word 
out, then the second ... to flow with the project, expressing her ikigai. 

As soon as you take these first small steps, your anxiety will disappear and you 
will achieve a pleasant flow in the activity you’re doing. Getting back to Albert 
Einstein, “a happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell on the future.”-

Strategy 3: Concentrate on a single task 

This is perhaps one of the greatest obstacles we face today, with so much 
technology and so many distractions. We’re listening to a video on YouTube 
while writing an e-mail, when suddenly a chat prompt pops up and we answer it. 
Then our smartphone vibrates in our pocket; just as soon as we respond to that 
message, we’re back at our computer, logging on to Facebook. 

Pretty soon thirty minutes have passed, and we’ve forgotten what the e-mail 
we were writing was supposed to be about. 

This also happens sometimes when we put on a movie with dinner and don’t 
realize how delicious the salmon was until we’re taking the last bite. 

We often think that combining tasks will save us time, but scientific evidence 
shows that it has the opposite effect. Even those who claim to be good at 
multitasking are not very productive. In fact, they are some of the least 
productive people. 

Our brains can take in millions of bits of information but can only actually 
process a few dozen per second. When we say we’re multitasking, what we’re 
really doing is switching back and forth between tasks very quickly. 
Unfortunately, we’re not computers adept at parallel processing. We end up 
spending all our energy alternating between tasks, instead of focusing on doing 
one of them well. 

Concentrating on one thing at a time may be the single most important factor in 
achieving flow. 

According to Csikszentmihalyi, in order to focus on a task we need: 

1. To be in a distraction-free environment 

2. To have control over what we are doing at every moment 

Technology is great, if we’re in control of it. It’s not so great if it takes control 
of us. For example, if you have to write a research paper, you might sit down at 
your computer and use Google to look up the information you need. However, if 
you’re not very disciplined, you might end up surfing the Web instead of writing 
that naner. In that case. Google and the Internet will have taken over, nulling vou 



CP J 


out of your state of flow. 

It has been scientifically shown that if we continually ask our brains to switch 
back and forth between tasks, we waste time, make more mistakes, and 
remember less of what we’ve done. 

Several studies conducted at Stanford University by Clifford Ivar Nass 
describe our generation as suffering from an epidemic of multitasking. One such 
study analyzed the behavior of hundreds of students, dividing them into groups 
based on the number of things they tended to do at once. The students who were 
the most addicted to multitasking typically alternated among more than four 
tasks; for example, taking notes while reading a textbook, listening to a podcast, 
answering messages on their smartphone, and sometimes checking their Twitter 
timeline. 

Each group of students was shown a screen with several red and several blue 
arrows. The objective of the exercise was to count the red arrows. 

At first, all the students answered correctly right away, without much trouble. 
As the number of blue arrows increased (the number of red arrows stayed the 
same; only their position changed), however, the students accustomed to 
multitasking had serious trouble counting the red arrows in the time allotted, or as 
quickly as the students who did not habitually multitask, for one very simple 
reason: They got distracted by the blue arrows! Their brains were trained to pay 
attention to every stimulus, regardless of its importance, while the brains of the 
other students were trained to focus on a single task—in this case, counting the 
red arrows and ignoring the blue ones.- 

Other studies indicate that working on several things at once lowers our 
productivity by at least 60 percent and our IQ by more than ten points. 

One study funded by the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social 
Research found that a sample group of more than four thousand young adults 
between the ages of twenty and twenty-four who were addicted to their 
smartphones got less sleep, felt less connected to their community at school, and 
were more likely to show signs of depression.-

What can we do to avoid falling victim to this flow-impeding epidemic? How 
can we train our brains to focus on a single task? Here are a few ideas for 
creating a space and time free of distractions, to increase our chances of reaching 
a state of flow and thereby getting in touch with our ikigai: 

■ Don’t look at any kind of screen for the first hour you’re awake and the last 
hour before you go to sleep. 

■ Turn off your phone before you achieve flow. There is nothing more 
important than the task you have chosen to do during this time. If this seems 
too extreme, enable the “do not disturb” function so only the people closest 
to you can contact you in case of emergency. 

■ Designate one day of the week, perhaps a Saturday or Sunday, a day of 
technological “fasting,” making exceptions only for e-readers (without Wi¬ 
Fi) or MP3 players. 

■ Go to a cafe that doesn’t have Wi-Fi. 

■ Read and respond to e-mail only once or twice per day. Define those times 
clearly and stick to them. 

■ Try the Pomodoro Technique: Get yourself a kitchen timer (some are made 
to look like a pomodoro, or tomato) and commit to working on a single task 
as long as it’s running. The Pomodoro Technique recommends 25 minutes of 
work and 5 minutes of rest for each cycle, but you can also do 50 minutes of 
work and 10 minutes of rest. Find the pace that’s best for you; the most 
important thing is to be disciplined in completing each cycle. 

■ Start your work session with a ritual you enjoy and end it with a reward. 

■ Train your mind to return to the present when you find yourself getting 
distracted. Practice mindfulness or another form of meditation, go for a 
walk or a swim—whatever will help you get centered again. 

■ Work in a space where you will not be distracted. If you can’t do this at 
home, go to a library, a cafe, or, if your task involves playing the saxophone, 
a music studio. If you find that your surroundings continue to distract you, 
keep looking until you find the right place. 




■ Divide each activity into groups of related tasks, and assign each group its 
own place and time. For example, if you’re writing a magazine article, you 
could do research and take notes at home in the morning, write in the library 
in the afternoon, and edit on the couch at night. 

■ Bundle routine tasks—such as sending out invoices, making phone calls, and 
so on—and do them all at once.

Flow in Japan: Takumis, engineers, geniuses, and otakus 

What do takumis (artisans), engineers, inventors, and otakus (fans of anime and 
manga) have in common? They all understand the importance of flowing with 
their ikigai at all times. 

One widespread stereotype about people in Japan is that they’re exceptionally 
dedicated and hardworking, even though some Japanese people say they look like 
they’re working harder than they really are. There is no doubt, though, about their 
ability to be completely absorbed in a task, or about their perseverance when 
there is a problem to be solved. One of the first words one learns when starting 
Japanese lessons is ganbaru , which means “to persevere” or “to stay firm by doing 
one’s best.” 




Japanese people often apply themselves to even the most basic tasks with an 
intensity that borders on obsession. We see this in all kinds of contexts, from the 
“retirees” taking meticulous care of their rice fields in the mountains of Nagano 
to the college students working the weekend shift in convenience stores known as 
konbinis. If you go to Japan, you’ll experience this attention to detail firsthand in 
almost every transaction. 

Walk into one of the stores that sell handcrafted objects in Naha, Kanazawa, 
or Kyoto and you’ll also discover that Japan is a treasure trove of traditional 
craftwork. The people of Japan have a unique talent for creating new 
technologies while preserving artisanal traditions and techniques. 


The art of the takumi 

Toyota employs “artisans” who are able to make a certain type of screw by hand. 
These takumi, or experts in a particular manual skill, are extremely important to 
Toyota, and they are hard to replace. Some of them are the only people who 
know how to perform their exact skill, and it doesn’t seem as though a new 
generation is going to take up the mantle. 

Turntable needles are another example: They’re produced almost exclusively 
in Japan, where you can find the last remaining people who know how to use the 
machinery required to make these precision needles, and who are trying to pass 
on their knowledge to their descendants. 

We met a takumi on a visit to Kumano, a small town near Hiroshima. We were 
there for the day, working on a photo essay for one of the most famous brands of 
makeup brushes in the West. The billboard welcoming visitors to Kumano shows 
a mascot holding a large brush. In addition to the brush factories, the town is full 
of little houses and vegetable gardens; heading farther in, you can see several 
Shinto shrines at the base of the mountains that surround the town. 

We spent hours taking photos in factories full of people in orderly rows, each 
doing a single task—such as painting the handles of the brushes or loading boxes 
of them onto trucks—before we realized we still hadn’t seen anyone actually 
putting bristles into the brush heads. 

After we asked about this and got the runaround several times, the president 
of one company agreed to show us how it was done. He led us out of the building 
and asked us to get into his car. After a five-minute drive we parked next to 
another, smaller structure and climbed the stairs. He opened a door and we

In the middle of the room was a woman wearing a mask. You could see only 
her eyes. She was so focused on choosing individual bristles for the brushes— 
gracefully moving her hands and fingers, using scissors and combs to sort the 
bristles—that she didn’t even notice our presence. Her movements were so quick 
it was hard to tell what she was doing. 

The president of the company interrupted her to let her know that we’d be 
taking photos as she worked. We couldn’t see her mouth, but the glint in her eye 
and the cheerful inflection in her speech let us know she was smiling. She looked 
happy and proud talking about her work and responsibilities. 

We had to use extremely fast shutter speeds to capture her movements. Her 
hands danced and flowed in concert with her tools and the bristles she was 
sorting. 

The president told us that this takumi was one of the most important people in 
the company, even though she was hidden away in a separate building. Every 
bristle of every brush the company made passed through her hands. 


Steve Jobs in Japan 

Apple cofounder Steve Jobs was a big fan of Japan. Not only did he visit the Sony 
factories in the 1980s and adopt many of their methods when he founded Apple, 
he was also captivated by the simplicity and quality of Japanese porcelain in 
Kyoto. 

It was not, however, an artisan from Kyoto who won Steve Jobs’s devotion, but 
rather a takumi from Toyama named Yukio Shakunaga, who used a technique 
called Etchu Seto-yaki, known by only a few. 

On a visit to Kyoto, Jobs heard of an exhibition of Shakunaga’s work. He 
immediately understood that there was something special about Shakunaga’s 
porcelain. As a matter of fact, he bought several cups, vases, and plates, and went 
back to the show three times that week. 

Jobs returned to Kyoto several times over the course of his life in search of 
inspiration, and ended up meeting Shakunaga in person. It is said that Jobs had 
many questions for him—almost all of them about the fabrication process and the 
type of porcelain he used. 

Shakunaga explained that he used white porcelain he extracted himself from 
mountains in the Toyama prefecture, making him the only artist of his ilk 


familiar with the fabrication process of porcelain objects from their origins in the 
mountains to their final form—an authentic takumi. 

Jobs was so impressed that he considered going to Toyama to see the mountain 
where Shakunaga got his porcelain, but thought better of it when he heard that it 
was more than four hours by train from Kyoto. 

In an interview after Jobs’s death, Shakunaga said he was very proud that his 
work had been appreciated by the man who created the iPhone. He added that 
Jobs’s last purchase from him had been a set of twelve teacups. Jobs had asked 
for something special, “a new style.” To satisfy this request, Shakunaga made 150 
teacups in the process of testing out new ideas. Of these, he chose the twelve best 
and sent them to the Jobs family. 

Ever since his first trip to Japan, Jobs was fascinated and inspired by the 
country’s artisans, engineers (especially at Sony), philosophy (especially Zen), and 
cuisine (especially sushi).- 


Sophisticated simplicity 

What do Japanese artisans, engineers, Zen philosophy, and cuisine have in 
common? Simplicity and attention to detail. It is not a lazy simplicity but a 
sophisticated one that searches out new frontiers, always taking the object, the 
body and mind, or the cuisine to the next level, according to one’s ikigai. 

As Csikszentmihalyi would say, the key is always having a meaningful 
challenge to overcome in order to maintain flow. 

The documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi gives us another example of a takumi, 
this time in the kitchen. Its protagonist has been making sushi every day for more 
than eighty years, and owns a small sushi restaurant near the Ginza subway station 
in Tokyo. He and his son go every day to the famous Tsukiji fish market and 
choose the best fish to bring back to the restaurant. 

In the documentary, we see one of Jiro’s apprentices learning to make tamago 
(a thin, slightly sweet omelet). No matter how hard he tries, he can’t get Jiro’s 
approval. He keeps practicing for years until he finally does. 

Why does the apprentice refuse to give up? Doesn’t he get bored cooking eggs 
every day? No, because making sushi is his ikigai, too. 

Both Jiro and his son are culinary artists. They don’t get bored when they cook 
—they achieve a state of flow. They enjoy themselves completely when they are 


in the kitchen; that is their happiness, their ikigai. They’ve learned to take 
pleasure in their work, to lose their sense of time. 

Beyond the close relationship between father and son, which helps them keep 
the challenge going each day, they also work in a quiet, peaceful environment that 
allows them to concentrate. Even after receiving a three-star rating from 
Michelin, they never considered opening other locations or expanding the 
business. They serve just ten patrons at a time at the bar of their small restaurant. 
Jiro’s family isn’t looking to make money; instead they value good working 
conditions and creating an environment in which they can flow while making the 
best sushi in the world. 

Jiro, like Yukio Shakunaga, begins his work at “the source.” He goes to the 
fish market to find the best tuna; Shakunaga goes to the mountains to find the 
best porcelain. When they get down to work, both become one with the object 
they are creating. This unity with the object that they reach in a state of flow 
takes on special meaning in Japan, where, according to Shintoism, forests, trees, 
and objects have a kami (spirit or god) within them. 

When someone—whether an artist, an engineer, or a chef—sets out to create 
something, his or her responsibility is to use nature to give it “life” while 
respecting that nature at every moment. During this process, the artisan becomes 
one with the object and flows with it. An ironworker would say that metal has a 
life of its own, just as someone making ceramics would say that the clay does. 

The Japanese are skilled at bringing nature and technology together: not man 
versus nature, but rather a union of the two. 


The purity of Ghibli 

There are those who say that the Shinto value of being connected with nature is 
vanishing. One of the harshest critics of this loss is another artist with a clearly 
defined ikigai : Hayao Miyazaki, the director of the animated films produced by 
Studio Ghibli. 

In nearly all his films we see humans, technology, fantasy, and nature in a state 
of conflict—and, in the end, coming together. One of the most poignant 
metaphors in his film Spirited Away is an obese spirit covered in trash that 
represents the pollution of the rivers. 

In Miyazaki’s films, forests have personalities, trees have feelings, and robots 
befriend birds. Considered a national treasure by the Japanese government, 


Miyazaki is an artist capable of becoming completely absorbed in his art. He uses 
a cell phone from the late 1990s, and he makes his entire team draw by hand. He 
“directs” his films by rendering on paper even the tiniest detail, achieving flow by 
drawing, not by using a computer. Thanks to this obsession on the director’s part, 
Studio Ghibli is one of the only studios in the world where almost the entire 
production process is carried out using traditional techniques. 

Those who have visited Studio Ghibli know that it is fairly typical, on a given 
Sunday to see a solitary individual tucked away in a corner, hard at work—a man 
in simple clothes who will greet them with an ohayo (hello) without looking up. 

Miyazaki is so passionate about his work that he spends many Sundays in the 
studio, enjoying the state of flow, putting his ikigai above all else. Visitors know 
that under no circumstances is one to bother Miyazaki, who is known for his 
quick temper—especially if he is interrupted while drawing. 

In 2013, Miyazaki announced he was going to retire. To commemorate his 
retirement, the television station NHK made a documentary showing him in his 
last days at work. He is drawing in nearly every scene of the film. In one scene, 
several of his colleagues are seen coming out of a meeting, and there he is, 
drawing in a corner, paying no attention to them. In another scene, he is shown 
walking to work on December 30 (a national holiday in Japan) and opening the 
doors of Studio Ghibli so he can spend the day there, drawing alone. 

Miyazaki can’t stop drawing. The day after his “retirement,” instead of going 
on vacation or staying at home, he went to Studio Ghibli and sat down to draw. 
His colleagues put on their best poker faces, not knowing what to say. One year 
later, he announced he wouldn’t make any more feature films but that he would 
keep on drawing until the day he died. 

Can someone really retire if he is passionate about what he does? 


The recluses 

It is not only the Japanese who have this capacity; there are artists and scientists 
all over the world with strong, clear ikigais. They do what they love until their 
dying day. 

The last thing Einstein wrote before closing his eyes forever was a formula 
that attempted to unite all the forces of the universe in a single theory. When he 
died, he was still doing what he loved. If he hadn’t been a physicist, he said, he 
would have been happy as a musician. When he wasn’t focused on physics or 


mathematics, he enjoyed playing the violin. Reaching a state of flow while 
working on his formulas or playing music, his two ikigais, brought him endless 
pleasure. 

Many such artists might seem misanthropic or reclusive, but what they are 
really doing is protecting the time that brings them happiness, sometimes at the 
expense of other aspects of their lives. They are outliers who apply the principles 
of flow to their lives to an extreme. 

Another example of this kind of artist is the novelist Haruki Murakami. He 
sees only a close circle of friends, and appears in public in Japan only once every 
few years. 

Artists know how important it is to protect their space, control their 
environment, and be free of distractions if they want to flow with their ikigai. 


Microflow: Enjoying mundane tasks 

But what happens when we have to, say, do the laundry, mow the lawn, or attend 
to paperwork? Is there a way to make these mundane tasks enjoyable? 

Near the Shinjuku subway station, in one of the neural centers of Tokyo, there 
is a supermarket that still employs elevator operators. The elevators are fairly 
standard and could easily be operated by the customers, but the store prefers to 
provide the service of someone holding the door open for you, pushing the button 
for your floor, and bowing as you exit. 

If you ask around, you’ll leam that there is one elevator operator who has been 
doing the same job since 2004. She is always smiling and enthusiastic about her 
work. How is she able to enjoy such a job? Doesn’t she get bored doing 
something so repetitive? 

On closer inspection, it becomes clear that the elevator operator is not just 
pushing buttons but is instead performing a whole sequence of movements. She 
begins by greeting the customers with a songlike salutation followed by a bow and 
a welcoming wave of the hand. Then she presses the elevator button with a 
graceful movement, as though she is a geisha offering a client a cup of tea. 

Csikszentmihalyi calls this microflow. 

We’ve all been bored in a class or at a conference and started doodling to keep 
ourselves entertained. Or whistled while painting a wall. If we’re not truly being 
challenged, we get bored and add a layer of complexity to amuse ourselves. Our 
ability to turn routine tasks into moments of microflow, into something we enjoy,

Even Bill Gates washes the dishes every night. He says he enjoys it—that it 
helps him relax and clear his mind, and that he tries to do it a little better each 
day, following an established order or set of rules he’s made for himself: plates 
first, forks second, and so on. 

It’s one of his daily moments of microflow. 

Richard Feynman, one of the most important physicists of all time, also took 
pleasure in routine tasks. W. Daniel Hillis, one of the founders of the 
supercomputer manufacturer Thinking Machines, hired Feynman to work on the 
development of a computer that could handle parallel processing when he was 
already world famous. He says Feynman showed up on his first day of work and 
said, “OK, boss, what’s my assignment?” They didn’t have anything prepared, so 
they asked him to work on a certain mathematical problem. He immediately 
realized they were giving him an irrelevant task to keep him busy and said, “That 
sounds like a bunch of baloney—give me something real to do.” 

So they sent him to a nearby shop to buy office supplies, and he completed his 
assignment with a smile on his face. When he didn’t have something important to 
do or needed to rest his mind, Feynman dedicated himself to microflowing—say, 
painting the office walls. 

Weeks later, after visiting the Thinking Machines offices a group of investors 
declared, “You have a Nobel laureate in there painting walls and soldering 
circuits. 


Instant vacations: Getting there through meditation 

Training the mind can get us to a place of flow more quickly. Meditation is one 
way to exercise our mental muscles. 

There are many types of meditation, but they all have the same objective: 
calming the mind, observing our thoughts and emotions, and centering our focus 
on a single object. 

The basic practice involves sitting with a straight back and focusing on your 
breath. Anyone can do it, and you feel a difference after just one session. By 
fixing your attention on the air moving in and out of your nose, you can slow the 
torrent of thoughts and clear your mental horizons. 


The Archer’s Secret 



The winner of the 1988 Olympic gold medal for archery was a seventeen- 
year-old woman from South Korea. When asked how she prepared, she 
replied that the most important part of her training was meditating for two 
hours each day. 


If we want to get better at reaching a state of flow, meditation is an excellent 
antidote to our smartphones and their notifications constantly clamoring for our 
attention. 

One of the most common mistakes among people starting to meditate is 
worrying about doing it “right,” achieving absolute mental silence, or reaching 
“nirvana.” The most important thing is to focus on the journey. 

Since the mind is a constant swirl of thoughts, ideas, and emotions, slowing 
down the “centrifuge”—even for just a few seconds—can help us feel more 
rested and leave us with a sense of clarity. 

In fact, one of the things we learn in the practice of meditation is not to worry 
about anything that flits across our mental screen. The idea of killing our boss 
might flash into our mind, but we simply label it as a thought and let it pass like a 
cloud, without judging or rejecting it. It is only a thought—one of the sixty 
thousand we have every day, according to some experts. 

Meditation generates alpha and theta brain waves. For those experienced in 
meditation, these waves appear right away, while it might take a half hour for a 
beginner to experience them. These relaxing brain waves are the ones that are 
activated right before we fall asleep, as we lie in the sun, or right after taking a 
hot bath. 

We all carry a spa with us everywhere we go. It’s just a matter of knowing how 
to get in—something anyone can do, with a bit of practice. 


Humans as ritualistic beings 

Life is inherently ritualistic. We could argue that humans naturally follow rituals 
that keep us busy. In some modem cultures, we have been forced out of our 
ritualistic lives to pursue goal after goal in order to be seen as successful. But 
throughout history, humans have always been busy. We were hunting, cooking, 
farming, exploring, and raising families—activities that were structured as rituals 
to keep us busy throughout our days.

modern Japan. The main religions in Japan—Confucianism, Buddhism, and 
Shintoism—are all ones in which the rituals are more important than absolute 
rules. 

When doing business in Japan, process, manners, and how you work on 
something is more important than the final results. Whether this is good or bad 
for the economy is beyond the scope of this book. What is indisputable, though, 
is that finding flow in a “ritualistic workplace” is much easier than in one in 
which we are continually stressed out trying to achieve unclear goals set by our 
bosses. 

Rituals give us clear rules and objectives, which help us enter a state of flow. 
When we have only a big goal in front of us, we might feel lost or overwhelmed 
by it; rituals help us by giving us the process, the substeps, on the path to 
achieving a goal. When confronted with a big goal, try to break it down into parts 
and then attack each part one by one. 

Focus on enjoying your daily rituals, using them as tools to enter a state of 
flow. Don’t worry about the outcome—it will come naturally. Happiness is in the 
doing, not in the result. As a rule of thumb, remind yourself: “Rituals over goals.” 

The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones 
who spend more time than others in a state of flow. 


Using flow to find your ikigai 

After reading this chapter you should have a better idea of which activities in 
your life make you enter flow. Write all of them on a piece of paper, then ask 
yourself these questions: What do the activities that drive you to flow have in 
common? Why do those activities drive you to flow? For example, are all the 
activities you most like doing ones that you practice alone or with other people? 
Do you flow more when doing things that require you to move your body or just 
to think? 

In the answers to these questions you might find the underlying ikigai that 
drives your life. If you don’t, then keep searching by going deeper into what you 
like by spending more of your time in the activities that make you flow. Also, try 
new things that are not on the list of what makes you flow but that are similar and 
that you are curious about. For example, if photography is something that drives 
you into flow, you could also try painting; you might even like it more! Or if you 
love snowboarding and have never tried surfing . . . 


Flow is mysterious. It is like a muscle: the more you train it, the more you will 
flow, and the closer you will be to your ikigai. 




MASTERS OF LONGEVITY 

Words of wisdom from the 
longest-living people in the world 



when we started working on this book, we didn’t want to just research the factors that contribute to a long and 
happy life; we wanted to hear from the true masters of this art. 

The interviews we conducted in Okinawa merit their own chapter, but in the 
section that precedes it we have provided an overview of the life philosophies of 
a few international champions of longevity. We’re talking about 
supercentenarians—people who live to 110 years of age or more. 

The term was coined in 1970 by Norris McWhirter, editor of The Guinness 
Book of World Records. Its use became more widespread in the 1990s, after it 
appeared in William Strauss and Neil Howe’s Generations. Today there are an 
estimated 300 to 450 supercentenarians in the world, although the age of only 
around 75 of them has been confirmed. They aren’t superheroes, but we could see 
them as such for having spent far more time on this planet than the average life 
expectancy would predict. 

Given the rise in life expectancy around the world, the number of 
supercentenarians might also increase. A healthy and purposeful life could help 
us join their ranks. 

Let’s take a look at what a few of them have to say. 


Misao Okawa (117) 

“Eat and sleep, and you’ll live a long time. You have to learn to 
relax.” 

According to the Gerontology Research Group, until April 2015, the oldest living 
person in the world was Misao Okawa, who passed away in a care facility in 
Osaka, Japan, after living for 117 years and 27 days. 

The daughter of a textile merchant, she was born in 1898, when Spain lost its 
colonies in Cuba and the Philippines, and the United States annexed Hawaii and 
launched Pepsi-Cola. Until she was 110, this woman—who lived in three 
different centuries—cared for herself unassisted. 

When specialists asked about her self-care routine, Misao answered simply, 
“Eating sushi and sleeping,” to which we should add, having a tremendous thirst 


for life. When they inquired about her secret for longevity, she answered with a 
smile, “I ask myself the same thing.”- 

Proof that Japan continues to be a factory of long life: In July of the same year 
Sakari Momoi passed away at 112 years and 150 days old. At the time he was the 
oldest man in the world, though he was younger than fifty-seven women. 


Maria Capovilla (116) 

“I’ve never eaten meat in my life.” 

Born in Ecuador in 1889, Maria Capovilla was recognized by Guinness as the 
world’s oldest person. She died of pneumonia in 2006, at 116 years and 347 days 
old, leaving behind three children, twelve grandchildren, and twenty great-and 
great-great-grandchildren. 

She gave one of her last interviews at age 107, sharing her memories and her 
thoughts: 


I’m happy, and I give thanks to God, who keeps me going. I never thought I'd live so long, I thought I'd 
die long ago. My husband, Antonio Capovilla, was the captain of a ship. He passed away at 84. We had 
two daughters and a son, and now I have many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 

Things were better, back in the old days. People behaved better. We used to dance, but we were 
more restrained; there was this one song I loved dancing to: “Maria” by Luis Alarcon. I still remember 
most of the words. I also remember many prayers, and say them every day. 

I like the waltz, and can still dance it. I also still make crafts, I still do some of the things I did when 
I was in school.^ 


When she had finished recalling her past, she began to dance—one of her 
great passions—with an energy that made her seem decades younger. 

When asked about her secret for longevity, she responded simply, “I don’t 
know what the secret to long life is. The only thing I do is I’ve never eaten meat in 
my life. I attribute it to that.” 


Jeanne Calment (122) 

“Everything’s fine.” 

Born in Arles, France, in February 1875, Jeanne Calment lived until August 4, 
1997, making her, at 122, the oldest person of verified age in history. She 
jokingly said that she “competed with Methuselah,” and there is no question that 


she broke numerous records as she went on celebrating birthdays. 

She died of natural causes at the end of a happy life during which she denied 
herself almost nothing. She rode a bicycle until she turned 100. She lived on her 
own until 110, when she agreed to move into a nursing home after accidentally 
starting a small fire in her apartment. She stopped smoking at 120, when her 
cataracts started making it hard for her to bring a cigarette to her lips. 

One of her secrets may have been her sense of humor. As she said on her 
120th birthday, “I see badly, I hear badly, and I feel bad, but everything’s fine.”- 


Walter Breuning (114) 

“If you keep your mind and body busy, you’ll be around a long 
time.” 

Born in Minnesota in 1896, Walter Breuning was able to see three centuries in his 
lifetime. He died in Montana in 2011, from natural causes; he’d had two wives 
and a fifty-year career on the railroad. At eighty-three he retired to an assisted 
living center in Montana, where he remained until his death. He is the second- 
oldest man (of verified age) ever born in the United States. 

He gave many interviews in his final years, insisting that his longevity 
stemmed from, among other things, his habit of eating only two meals per day 
and working for as many years as he could. “Your mind and your body. You keep 
both busy,” he said on his 112th birthday, “you’ll be here a long time.” Back then, 
he was still exercising every day. 

Among Breuning’s other secrets: He had a habit of helping others, and he 
wasn’t afraid of dying. As he declared in a 2010 interview with the Associated 
Press, “We’re all going to die. Some people are scared of dying. Never be afraid 
to die. Because you’re born to die.”- 

Before passing away in 2011, he is said to have told a pastor that he’d made a 
deal with God: If he wasn’t going to get better, it was time to go. 


Alexander Imich (111) 

“I just haven’t died yet.” 

Bom in Poland in 1903, Alexander Imich was a chemist and parapsychologist 

rpeirlincr in thp TTnifprl fitntpe whn nftpr thn Hpnth of hie nrpHpppeenr in 901 A

became the oldest man of authenticated age in the world. Imich himself died 
shortly thereafter, in June of that year, leaving behind a long life rich with 
experiences. 

Imich attributed his longevity to, among other things, never drinking alcohol. 
“It’s not as though I’d won the Nobel Prize,” he said upon being declared the 
world’s oldest man. “I never thought I’d get to be so old.” When asked about his 
secret to living so long, his answer was “I don’t know. I just haven’t died yet.”- 


Ikigai artists 

The secret to long life, however, is not held by supercentenarians alone. There are 
many people of advanced age who, though they haven’t made it into Guinness 
World Records , offer us inspiration and ideas for bringing energy and meaning to 
our lives. 

Artists, for example, who carry the torch of their ikigai instead of retiring, 
have this power. 

Art, in all its forms, is an ikigai that can bring happiness and purpose to our 
days. Enjoying or creating beauty is free, and something all human beings have 
access to. 

Hokusai, the Japanese artist who made woodblock prints in the ukiyo-e style 
and lived for 88 years, from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century, 
added this postscript to the first edition of his One Hundred Views of Mount 
Fuji:- 


All that I have produced before the age of 70 is not worth being counted. It is at the age of 73 that I 
have somewhat begun to understand the structure of true nature, of animals and grasses, and trees and 
birds, and fishes and insects; consequently at 80 years of age I shall have made still more progress; at 
90 I hope to have penetrated into the mystery of things; at 100 years of age I should have reached 
decidedly a marvelous degree, and when I shall be 110, all that I do, every point and every line, shall be 
instinct with life. 


In the pages that follow, we’ve collected some of the most inspirational words 
from artists interviewed by Camille Sweeney for the New York Times .- Of those 
still living, none have retired, and all still enjoy their passion, which they plan to 
pursue until their final breath, demonstrating that when you have a clear purpose, 
no one can stop you. 



The actor Christopher Plummer, still working at eighty-six, reveals a dark 
desire shared by many who love the profession: “We want to drop dead onstage. 
That would be a nice theatrical way to go.”- 

Osamu Tezuka, the father of modern Japanese manga, shared this feeling. 
Before he died in 1989, his last words as he drew one final cartoon were “Please, 
just let me work!’- 

The eighty-six-year-old filmmaker Frederick Wiseman declared on a stroll 
through Paris that he likes to work, which is why he does it with such intensity. 
“Everybody complains about their aches and pains and all that, but my friends are 
either dead or are still working,” he said.— 

Carmen Herrera, a painter who just entered her one hundredth year, sold her 
first canvas at age eighty-nine. Today her work is in the permanent collections of 
the Tate Modem and the Museum of Modern Art. When asked how she viewed 
her future, she responded, “I am always waiting to finish the next thing. Absurd, I 
know. I go day by day.”— 


Never Stop Learning 

“You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake 
at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only 
love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know 
your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one 
thing for it then—to leam. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. 
That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, 
never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of 
regretting.” 

—T. H. White, The Once and Future King 


For his part, naturalist and author Edward O. Wilson asserted, “I feel I have 
enough experience to join those who are addressing big questions. About ten 
years ago, when I began reading and thinking more broadly about the questions of 
what are we, where did we come from and where are we going, I was astonished 
at how little this was being done.”— 

Ellsworth Kelly, an artist who passed away in 2015 at the age of ninety-two, 
assured us that the idea that we lose our faculties with age is, in part, a myth, 



because instead we develop a greater clarity and capacity for observation. “It’s 
one thing about getting older, you see more. . . . Every day I’m continuing to see 
new things. That’s why there are new paintings.”— 

At eighty-six, the architect Frank Gehry reminds us that some buildings can 
take seven years “from the time you’re hired until you’re finished,”- - a fact that 
favors a patient attitude with regard to the passage of time. The man responsible 
for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, however, knows how to live in the here and 
now: “You stay in your time. You don’t go backward. I think if you relate to the 
time you’re in, you keep your eyes and ears open, read the paper, see what’s going 
on, stay curious about everything, you will automatically be in your time.”— 


Longevity in Japan 

Because of its robust civil registry, many of those verified as having lived 
the longest are found in the United States; however, there are many 
centenarians living in remote villages in other countries. A peaceful life in 
the countryside seems pretty common among people who have watched a 
century pass. 

Without question, the international superstar of longevity is Japan, 
which has the highest life expectancy of any country in the world. In 
addition to a healthy diet, which we will explore in detail, and an 
integrated health care system in which people go to the doctor for regular 
checkups to prevent disease, longevity in Japan is closely tied to its 
culture, as we will see later on. 

The sense of community, and the fact that Japanese people make an 
effort to stay active until the very end, are key elements of their secret to 
long life. 

If you want to stay busy even when there’s no need to work, there has 
to be an ikigai on your horizon, a purpose that guides you throughout your 
life and pushes you to make things of beauty and utility for the 
community and yourself. 




LESSONS FROM JAPAN’S CENTENARIANS 

Traditions and proverbs for 
happiness and longevity 



TOGETToOgimi, we had to fly nearly three hours from Tokyo to Naha, the capital of Okinawa. Several months 
earlier we had contacted the town council of a place known as the Village of Longevity to explain the 
purpose of our trip and our intention to interview the oldest members of the community. After numerous 
conversations, we finally got the help we were looking for and were able to rent a house just outside the 
town. 

One year after starting this project, we found ourselves on the doorstep of 
some of the longest-living people in the world. 

We realized right away that time seems to have stopped there, as though the 
entire town were living in an endless here and now. 


Arriving in Ogimi 

After two hours on the road from Naha, we’re finally able to stop worrying about 
the traffic. To our left are the sea and an empty stretch of beach; to our right, the 
mountainous jungle of Okinawa’s Yanbaru forests. 

Once Route 58 passes Nago, where Orion beer—the pride of Okinawa—is 
made, it skirts the coast until it reaches Ogimi. Every now and then a few little 
houses and stores crop up in the narrow stretch of land between the road and the 
base of the mountain. 

We pass small clusters of houses scattered here and there as we enter the 
municipality of Ogimi, but the town doesn’t really seem to have a center. Our 
GPS finally guides us to our destination: the Center for the Support and 
Promotion of Well-Being, housed in an unattractive cinderblock building right 
off the highway. 

We go in through the back door, where a man named Taira is waiting for us. 
Beside him is a petite, cheerful woman who introduces herself as Yuki. Two 
other women immediately get up from desks and show us to a conference room. 
They serve us each a cup of green tea and a few shikuwasa, a small citrus fruit 
that packs a big nutritional punch, as we will see later on. 

Taira sits down across from us in his formal suit and opens up a large planner 
and a three-ring binder. Yuki sits next to him. The binder contains a list of all the 
town’s residents, organized by age and “club,” or moai. Taira points out that these 
groups of people who help one another are characteristic of Ogimi. The moai are 


not organized around any concrete objective; they function more like a family. 
Taira also tells us that volunteer work, rather than money, drives much of what 
happens in Ogimi. Everyone offers to pitch in, and the local government takes 
care of assigning tasks. This way, everyone can be useful and feels like a part of 
the community. 

Ogimi is the penultimate town before Cape Hedo, the northernmost point of 
the largest island in the archipelago. 

From the top of one of Ogimi’s mountains, we’re able to look down over the 
whole town. Almost everything is the green of the Yanbaru jungle, making us 
wonder where the nearly thirty-two hundred residents are hiding. We can see a 
few houses, but they’re scattered in little clusters near the sea or in small valleys 
accessible by side roads. 


Communal life 

We’re invited to eat in one of Ogimi’s few restaurants, but when we arrive the 
only three tables are already reserved. 

“Don’t worry, we’ll go to Churaumi instead. It never fills up,” says Yuki, 
walking back to her car. 

She’s still driving at age eighty-eight, and takes great pride in that. Her copilot 
is ninety-nine, and has also decided to spend the day with us. We have to drive 
fast to keep up with them on a highway that is sometimes more dirt than asphalt. 
Finally reaching the other end of the jungle, we can at last sit down to eat. 

“I don’t really go to restaurants,” Yuki says as we take our seats. “Almost 
everything I eat comes from my vegetable garden, and I buy my fish from 
Tanaka, who’s been my friend forever.” 

The restaurant is right by the sea and seems like something from the planet 
Tatooine, from Star Wars. The menu boasts in large letters that it serves “slow 
food” prepared with organic vegetables grown in the town. 

“But really,” Yuki continues, “food is the least important thing.” She is 
extroverted, and rather pretty. She likes to talk about her role as the director of 
several associations run by the local government. 

“Food won’t help you live longer,” she says, bringing to her lips a bite of the 
diminutive confection that followed our meal. “The secret is smiling and having a 
good time.” 

There are no bars and only a few restaurants in Ogimi, but those who live

divided into seventeen neighborhoods, and each one has a president and several 
people in charge of things like culture, festivals, social activities, and longevity. 
Residents pay close attention to this last category. 

We’re invited to the community center of one of the seventeen neighborhoods. 
It is an old building right next to one of the mountains of the Yanbaru jungle, 
home to bunagaya, the town’s iconic sprites. 


The Bunagaya Spirits of the Yanbaru Jungle 

Bunagaya are magical creatures that inhabit the Yanbaru jungle near 
Ogimi and its surrounding towns. They manifest as children with long red 
hair, and like to hide in the jungle’s gajumaru (banyan) trees and go 
fishing on the beach. 

Many of Okinawa’s stories and fables are about bunagaya sprites. They 
are mischievous, playful, and unpredictable. Locals say that the bunagaya 
love the mountains, rivers, sea, trees, earth, wind, and animals, and that if 
you want to befriend them, you have to show respect for nature. 


A birthday party 

When we arrive at the neighborhood’s community center, we’re greeted by a 
group of about twenty people who proudly proclaim, “The youngest among us is 
eighty-three!” 

We conduct our interviews at a large table while drinking green tea. When we 
finish, we’re brought to an event space, where we celebrate the birthdays of three 
members of the group. One woman is turning ninety-nine, another ninety-four, 
and one “young man” has just reached eighty-nine. 

We sing a few songs popular in the village and finish up with “Happy 
Birthday” in English. The woman turning ninety-nine blows out the candles and 
thanks everyone for coming to her party. We eat homemade shikuwasa cake and 
end up dancing and celebrating as though it were the birthday of a 
twentysomething. 

It’s the first party, but not the last, that we’ll attend during our week in the 
village. We’ll also do karaoke with a group of seniors who sing better than we do, 
and attend a traditional festival with local bands, dancers, and food stands at the 





foot of a mountain. 


Celebrate each day, together 

Celebrations seem to be an essential part of life in Ogimi. 

We’re invited to watch a game of gateball, one of the most popular sports 
among Okinawa’s older residents. It involves hitting a ball with a mallet-like stick. 
It is a low-impact sport that can be played anywhere, and is a good excuse to 
move around and have fun as a group. The residents hold local competitions, and 
there is no age limit for participants. 

We participate in the weekly game and lose to a woman who recently turned 
104. Everyone cheers, and the defeated look on our faces elicits laughter. 

In addition to playing and celebrating as a community, spirituality is also 
essential to the happiness of the village’s residents. 


The gods of Okinawa 

The main religion in Okinawa is known as Ryukyu Shinto. Ryukyu is the original 
name of the Okinawa archipelago, and Shinto means “the path of the gods.”- 
Ryukyu Shinto combines elements of Chinese Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, 
and Shintoism with shamanistic and animistic elements. 

According to this ancient faith, the world is populated by an infinite number 
of spirits divided into several types: spirits of the home, of the forest, of the trees, 
and of the mountains. It is important to appease these spirits through rituals and 
festivals, and by consecrating sacred grounds. 

Okinawa is full of sacred jungles and forests, where many of the two main 
kinds of temples are found: the utaki and the uganju. We visited an uganju, or 
small, open-air temple adorned with incense and coins, next to a waterfall in 
Ogimi. The utaki is a collection of stones where people go to pray and where, 
supposedly, spirits gather. 

In Okinawa’s religious practice, women are considered spiritually superior to 
men, whereas the opposite is true of traditional Shintoism in the rest of Japan. 
Yuta are women chosen as mediums by their communities to make contact with 
the spirit realm through traditional rites. 


Ancestor worship is another important feature of spiritual practice in 
Okinawa, and in Japan in general. The home of each generation’s firstborn 
usually contains a butsudan, or small altar, used to pray for and make offerings to 
the family’s ancestors. 


Mabui 

Every person has an essence, or mabui. This mabui is our spirit and the 
source of our life force. It is immortal and makes us who we are. 

Sometimes, the mabui of someone who has died is trapped in the body 
of a living person. This situation requires a separation ritual to free the 
mabui of the deceased; it often happens when a person dies suddenly— 
especially at a young age—and his or her mabui does not want to move on 
to the realm of the dead. 

A mabui can also be passed from person to person by physical contact. 
A grandmother who leaves her granddaughter a ring transfers a part of her 
mabui to her. Photographs can also be a medium for passing mabui among 
people. 


The older, the stronger 

Looking back, our days in Ogimi were intense but relaxed—sort of like the 
lifestyle of the locals, who always seemed to be busy with important tasks but 
who, upon closer inspection, did everything with a sense of calm. They were 
always pursuing their ikigai, but they were never in a rush. 

Not only did they seem to be happily busy, but we also noticed that they 
followed the other principles for happiness that Washington Burnap stated two 
hundred years ago: “The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to 
do, something to love, and something to hope for.”- 

On our last day, we went to buy gifts at a small market at the edge of town. 
The only things sold there are local vegetables, green tea, and shikuwasa juice, 
along with bottles of water from a spring hidden in the Yanbaru forests, bearing 
labels that read “Longevity Water.” 

We bought ourselves some of this Longevity Water and drank it in the parking 
lot, looking out over the sea and hoping that the little bottles that promised a 



magic elixir would bring us health and long life, and would help us find our own 
ikigai. Then we took a photo with a statue of a bunagaya, and walked up to it one 
last time to read the inscription: 


A Declaration from the Town Where People Live Longest 

At 80 I am still a child. 

When I come to see you at 90, 
send me away to wait until I’m 100. 

The older, the stronger; 

let us not depend too much on our children as we age. 

If you seek long life and health, you are welcome in our village, 

where you will be blessed by nature, 

and together we will discover the secret to longevity.

The interviews 

Over the course of a week we conducted a total of one hundred interviews, asking 
the eldest members of the community about their life philosophy, their ikigai, and 
the secrets to longevity. We filmed these conversations with two cameras for use 
in a little documentary, and chose a few especially meaningful and inspiring 
statements to include in this section of the book. 

1. Don’t worry 

“The secret to a long life is not to worry. And to keep your heart young—don’t let it grow old. Open 
your heart to people with a nice smile on your face. If you smile and open your heart, your 
grandchildren and everyone else will want to see you.” 

“The best way to avoid anxiety is to go out in the street and say hello to people. I do it every day. I go 
out there and say, ‘Hello!’ and ‘See you later!’ Then I go home and care for my vegetable garden. In the 
afternoon, I spend time with friends.” 

“Here, everyone gets along. We try not to cause problems. Spending time together and having fun is 
the only thing that matters.” 



2. Cultivate good habits 

“I feel joy every morning waking up at six and opening the curtains to look out at my garden, where I 
grow my own vegetables. I go right outside to check on my tomatoes, my mandarin oranges ... I love 
the sight of them—it relaxes me. After an hour in the garden I go back inside and make breakfast.” 

“I plant my own vegetables and cook them myself. That’s my ikigai .” 

“The key to staying sharp in old age is in your fingers. From your fingers to your brain, and back again. 
If you keep your fingers busy, you'll live to see one hundred.” 

“I get up at four every day. I set my alarm for that time, have a cup of coffee, and do a little exercise, 
lifting my arms. That gives me energy for the rest of the day.” 

“I eat a bit of everything; I think that’s the secret. I like variety in what I eat; I think it tastes better.” 
“Working. If you don’t work, your body breaks down.” 

“When I wake up, I go to the butsudan and light incense. You have to keep your ancestors in mind. It’s 
the first thing I do every morning.” 

“I wake up every day at the same time, early, and spend the morning in my vegetable garden. I go 
dancing with my friends once a week.” 

“I do exercise every day, and every morning I go for a little walk.” 

“I never forget to do my taiso exercises when I get up.” 

“Eating vegetables—it helps you live longer.” 

“To live a long time you need to do three things: exercise to stay healthy, eat well, and spend time with 
people.” 

3. Nurture your friendships every day 

“Getting together with my friends is my most important ikigai. We all get together here and talk—it’s 
very important. I always know I'll see them all here tomorrow, and that’s one of my favorite things in 
life.” 

“My main hobby is getting together with friends and neighbors.” 

“Talking each day with the people you love, that’s the secret to a long life.” 

“I say, ‘Hello!’ and ‘See you later!’ to the children on their way to school, and wave at everyone who 
goes by me in their car. ‘Drive safely!’ I say. Between 7:20 a.m. and 8:15 a.m., I’m outside on my feet 
the whole time, saying hello to people. Once everyone’s gone, I go back inside.” 



'Chatting and drinking tea with my neighbors. That’s the best thing in life. And singing together. 


“I wake up at five every morning, leave the house, and walk to the sea. Then I go to a friend’s house 
and we have tea together. That’s the secret to long life: getting together with people, and going from 
place to place.” 


4. Live an unhurried life 

“My secret to a long life is always saying to myself, ‘Slow down,’ and ‘Relax.’ You live much longer if 
you’re not in a hurry.” 

“I make things with wicker. That’s my ikigai. The first thing I do when I wake up is pray. Then I do my 
exercises and eat breakfast. At seven I calmly start working on my wicker. When I get tired at five, I 
go visit my friends.” 

“Doing many different things every day. Always staying busy, but doing one thing at a time, without 
getting overwhelmed.” 

“The secret to long life is going to bed early, waking up early, and going for a walk. Living peacefully 
and enjoying the little things. Getting along with your friends. Spring, summer, fall, winter . . . 
enjoying each season, happily.” 

5. Be optimistic 

“Every day I say to myself, ‘Today will be full of health and energy. Live it to the fullest.’” 

“I’m ninety-eight, but consider myself young. I still have so much to do.” 

“Laugh. Laughter is the most important thing. I laugh wherever I go.” 

“I’m going to live to be a hundred. Of course I am! It’s a huge motivation for me.” 

“Dancing and singing with your grandchildren is the best thing in life.” 

“I feel very fortunate to have been born here. I give thanks for it every day.” 

“The most important thing in Ogirni, in life, is to keep smiling.” 

“I do volunteer work to give back to the village a bit of what it has given to me. For example, I use my 
car to help friends get to the hospital.” 

“There’s no secret to it. The trick is just to live.” 


Keys to the Ogimi Lifestyle 




■ One hundred percent of the people we interviewed keep a vegetable 
garden, and most of them also have fields of tea, mangoes, shikuwasa, 
and so on. 

■ All belong to some form of neighborhood association, where they feel 
cared for as though by family. 

■ They celebrate all the time, even little things. Music, song, and dance 
are essential parts of daily life. 

■ They have an important purpose in life, or several. They have an ikigai, 
but they don’t take it too seriously. They are relaxed and enjoy all that 
they do. 

■ They are very proud of their traditions and local culture. 

■ They are passionate about everything they do, however insignificant it 
might seem. 

■ Locals have a strong sense of yuimaaru —recognizing the connection 
between people. They help each other with everything from work in the 
fields (harvesting sugarcane or planting rice) to building houses and 
municipal projects. Our friend Miyagi, who ate dinner with us on our 
last night in town, told us that he was building a new home with the help 
of all his friends, and that we could stay there the next time we were in 
Ogimi. 

■ They are always busy, but they occupy themselves with tasks that allow 
them to relax. We didn’t see a single old grandpa sitting on a bench 
doing nothing. They’re always coming and going—to sing karaoke, visit 
with neighbors, or play a game of gateball. 





THE IKIGAI DIET 

What the world’s longest-living 
people eat and drink 



according to the World Health Organization, Japan has the highest life expectancy in the world: 85 years for 
men and 87.3 years for women. Moreover, it has the highest ratio of centenarians in the world: more than 
520 for every million people (as of September 2016).

The above graphic, which compares life expectancy in Japan, its province 
Okinawa, Sweden, and the United States, shows that, while life expectancy in 
Japan is high overall, Okinawa exceeds the national average. 

Okinawa is one of the areas in Japan that were most affected by World War II. 
As a result not only of conflicts on the battlefield but also of hunger and a lack of 
resources once the war ended, the average life expectancy was not very high 
during the 1940s and 1950s. As Okinawans recovered from the destruction, 
however, they came to be some of the country’s longest-living citizens.

makes it the best of the best in terms of life expectancy? 

Experts point out that, for one thing, Okinawa is the only province in Japan 
without trains. Its residents have to walk or cycle when not driving. It is also the 
only province that has managed to follow the Japanese government’s 
recommendation of eating less than ten grams of salt per day. 


Okinawa’s miracle diet 

The mortality rate from cardiovascular disease in Okinawa is the lowest in Japan, 
and diet almost certainly has a lot to do with this. It is no coincidence that the 
“Okinawa Diet” is so often discussed around the world at panels on nutrition. 

The most concrete and widely cited data on diet in Okinawa come from 
studies by Makoto Suzuki, a cardiologist at the University of the Ryukyus, who 
has published more than seven hundred scientific articles on nutrition and aging 
in Okinawa since 1970. 

Bradley J. Willcox and D. Craig Willcox joined Makoto Suzuki’s research 
team and published a book considered the bible on the subject, The Okinawa 
Program.- They reached the following conclusions: 

■ Locals eat a wide variety of foods, especially vegetables. Variety seems to be 
key. A study of Okinawa’s centenarians showed that they ate 206 different 
foods, including spices, on a regular basis. They ate an average of eighteen 
different foods each day, a striking contrast to the nutritional poverty of our 
fast-food culture. 

■ They eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. At least 
seven types of fruits and vegetables are consumed by Okinawans on a daily 
basis. The easiest way to check if there is enough variety on your table is to 
make sure you’re “eating the rainbow.” A table featuring red peppers, 
carrots, spinach, cauliflower, and eggplant, for example, offers great color 
and variety. Vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and soy products such as tofu are 
the staples of an Okinawan’s diet. More than 30 percent of their daily 
calories comes from vegetables. 

■ Grains are the foundation of their diet. Japanese people eat white rice every 
day, sometimes adding noodles. Rice is the primary food in Okinawa, as 
well. 


■ They rarely eat sugar, and if they do, it’s cane sugar. We drove through 
several sugarcane fields every morning on our way to Ogimi, and even drank 
a glass of cane juice at Nakijin Castle. Beside the stall selling the juice was a 
sign describing the anticarcinogenic benefits of sugarcane. 

In addition to these basic dietary principles, Okinawans eat fish an average of 
three times per week; unlike in other parts of Japan, the most frequently 
consumed meat is pork, though locals eat it only once or twice per week. 

Along these lines, Makoto Suzuki’s studies indicate the following: 

■ Okinawans consume, in general, one-third as much sugar as the rest of 
Japan’s population, which means that sweets and chocolate are much less a 
part of their diet. 

■ They also eat practically half as much salt as the rest of Japan: 7 grams per 
day, compared to an average of 12. 

■ They consume fewer calories: an average of 1,785 per day, compared to 
2,068 in the rest of Japan. In fact, low caloric intake is common among the 
five Blue Zones. 


Hara hachi bu 

This brings us back to the 80 percent rule we mentioned in the first chapter, a 
concept known in Japanese as hara hachi bu. It’s easy to do: When you notice 
you’re almost full but could have a little more ... just stop eating! 

One easy way to start applying the concept of hara hachi bu is to skip dessert. 
Or to reduce portion size. The idea is to still be a little bit hungry when you finish. 

This is why portion size tends to be much smaller in Japan than in the West. 
Food isn’t served as appetizers, main courses, and dessert. Instead, it’s much more 
common to see everything presented at once on small plates: one with rice, 
another with vegetables, a bowl of miso soup, and something to snack on. Serving 
food on many small plates makes it easier to avoid eating too much, and 
facilitates the varied diet discussed at the beginning of this chapter. 

Hara hachi bu is an ancient practice. The twelfth-century book on Zen 
Buddhism Zazen Youjinki recommends eating two-thirds as much as you might 
want to. Eating less than one might want is common among all Buddhist temples 


in the East. Perhaps Buddhism recognized the benefits of limiting caloric intake 
more than nine centuries ago. 


So, eat less to live longer? 

Few would challenge this idea. Without taking it to the extreme of malnutrition, 
of course, eating fewer calories than our bodies ask for seems to increase 
longevity. The key to staying healthy while consuming fewer calories is eating 
foods with a high nutritional value (especially “superfoods”) and avoiding those 
that add to our overall caloric intake but offer little to no nutritional value. 

The calorie restriction we’ve been discussing is one of the most effective ways 
to add years to your life. If the body regularly consumes enough, or too many, 
calories, it gets lethargic and starts to wear down, expending significant energy on 
digestion alone. 

Another benefit of calorie restriction is that it reduces levels of IGF-1 
(insulin-like growth factor 1) in the body. IGF-1 is a protein that plays a 
significant role in the aging process; it seems that one of the reasons humans and 
animals age is an excess of this protein in their blood.- 

Whether calorie restriction will extend lifespan in humans is not yet known, 
but data increasingly indicate that moderate calorie restriction with adequate 
nutrition has a powerful protective effect against obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
inflammation, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease and reduces metabolic 
risk factors associated with cancer.- 

An alternative to following the 80 percent rule on a daily basis is to fast for 
one or two days each week. The 5:2 (or fasting) diet recommends two days of 
fasting (consuming fewer than five hundred calories) every week and eating 
normally on the other five days. 

Among its many benefits, fasting helps cleanse the digestive system and allows 
it to rest. 


15 natural antioxidants found in the Okinawan diet 

Antioxidants are molecules that slow the oxidation process in cells, neutralizing 
the free radicals that cause damage and accelerate aging. The antioxidant power 
of green tea, for example, is well known, and will be discussed later at greater 


ICIiglll. 

Because they are rich in antioxidants and are eaten nearly every day in the 
region, these fifteen foods are considered keys to Okinawan vitality: 

■ Tofu 

■ Miso 

■ Tuna 

■ Carrots 

■ Goya (bitter melon) 

■ Kombu (sea kelp) 

■ Cabbage 

■ Nori (seaweed) 

■ Onion 

■ Soy sprouts 

■ Hechima (cucumber-like gourd) 

■ Soybeans (boiled or raw) 

■ Sweet potato 

■ Peppers 

■ Sanpin-cha (jasmine tea) 


Sanpin-cha: The reigning infusion in Okinawa 

Okinawans drink more Sanpin-cha—a mix of green tea and jasmine flowers— 
than any other kind of tea. The closest approximation in the West would be the 
jasmine tea that usually comes from China. A 1988 study conducted by Hiroko 
Sho at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology indicates that jasmine 
tea reduces blood cholesterol levels.- 

Sanpin-cha can be found in many different forms in Okinawa, and is even 
available in vending machines. In addition to all the antioxidant benefits of green 
tea, it boasts the benefits of jasmine, which include: 

■ Reducing the risk of heart attack 

■ Strengthening the immune system 

■ Helping relieve stress 

■ Lowering cholesterol

It might be hard to find exactly the same blend in the West, but we can drink 
jasmine tea, or even a high-quality green tea, instead. 


The secrets of green tea 

Green tea has been credited for centuries with significant medicinal properties. 
Recent studies have confirmed its many benefits, and have attested to the 
importance of this ancient plant in the longevity of those who drink it often. 

Originally from China, where it has been consumed for millennia, green tea 
didn’t make its way to the rest of the world until just a few centuries ago. Unlike 
other teas, and as a result of being air-dried without fermentation, it retains its 
active elements even after being dried and crumbled. It offers meaningful health 
benefits such as: 

■ Controlling cholesterol 

■ Lowering blood sugar levels 

■ Improving circulation 

■ Protection against the flu (vitamin C) 

■ Promoting bone health (fluoride) 

■ Protection against certain bacterial infections 

■ Protection against UV damage 

■ Cleansing and diuretic effects 

White tea, with its high concentration of polyphenols, may be even more 
effective against aging. In fact, it is considered to be the natural product with the 
greatest antioxidant power in the world—to the extent that one cup of white tea 
might pack the same punch as about a dozen glasses of orange juice. 

In summary: Drinking green or white tea every day can help us reduce the free 
radicals in our bodies, keeping us young longer. 


The powerful shikuwasa 

Shikuwasa is the citrus fruit par excellence of Okinawa, and Ogimi is its largest 
producer in all of Japan. 


The fruit is extremely acidic: It is impossible to drink shikuwasa juice without 
diluting it first with water. Its taste is somewhere between that of a lime and a 
mandarin orange, to which it bears a family resemblance. 

Shikuwasas also contain high levels of nobiletin, a flavonoid rich in 
antioxidants. 

All citrus fruits—grapefruits, oranges, lemons—are high in nobiletin, but 
Okinawa’s shikuwasas have forty times as much as oranges. Consuming nobiletin 
has been proven to protect us from arteriosclerosis, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and 
obesity in general. 

Shikuwasas also contain vitamins C and Bj, beta carotene, and minerals. They 

are used in many traditional dishes and to add flavor to food, and are squeezed to 
make juice. While conducting research at the birthday parties of the town’s 
“grandparents,” we were served shikuwasa cake. 


The Antioxidant Canon, for Westerners 

In 2010 the UK’s Daily Mirror published a list of foods recommended by 

experts to combat aging. Among these foods readily available in the West 

are: 

■ Vegetables such as broccoli and chard, for their high concentration of 
water, minerals, and fiber 

■ Oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines, for all the 
antioxidants in their fat 

■ Fruits such as citrus, strawberries, and apricots; they are an excellent 
source of vitamins and help eliminate toxins from the body 

■ Berries such as blueberries and goji berries; they are rich in 
phytochemical antioxidants 

■ Dried fruits, which contain vitamins and antioxidants, and give you 
energy 

■ Grains such as oats and wheat, which give you energy and contain 
minerals 

■ Olive oil, for its antioxidant effects that show in your skin 

■ Red wine, in moderation, for its antioxidant and vasodilatory properties 

Foods that should be eliminated are refined sugar and grains, processed 

baked goods, and prepared foods, along with cow’s milk and all its

GENTLE MOVEMENTS, LONGER LIFE 

Exercises from the East that 
promote health and longevity 



studies from the Blue Zones suggest that the people who live longest are not the ones who do the most exercise 
but rather the ones who move the most. 

When we visited Ogimi, the Village of Longevity, we discovered that even 
people over eighty and ninety years old are still highly active. They don’t stay at 
home looking out the window or reading the newspaper. Ogimi’s residents walk a 
lot, do karaoke with their neighbors, get up early in the morning, and, as soon as 
they’ve had breakfast—or even before—head outside to weed their gardens. They 
don’t go to the gym or exercise intensely, but they almost never stop moving in 
the course of their daily routines. 


As Easy as Getting out of Your Chair 

“Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The 
enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where 
it can get burned off, slow down. And after two hours, good cholesterol 
drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things 
going again. These things are so simple they’re almost stupid,” says Gavin 
Bradley 1 - in a 2015 interview with Brigid Schulte for the Washington Post.- 
Bradley is one of the preeminent experts on the subject, and the director 
of an international organization dedicated to building awareness of how 
detrimental sitting all the time can be to our health. 


If we live in a city, we might find it hard to move in natural and healthy ways 
every day, but we can turn to exercises that have proven for centuries to be good 
for the body. 

The Eastern disciplines for bringing body, mind, and soul into balance have 
become quite popular in the West, but in their countries of origin they have been 
used for ages to promote health. 

Yoga—originally from India, though very popular in Japan—and China’s 
qigong and tai chi, among other disciplines, seek to create harmony between a 
person’s body and mind so they can face the world with strength, joy, and 
serenity. 



nicy cue LUUICU Uf> CilAlif) ui yuum, CU1U 5>C1C11CC ll£lJ> CllLlUi5>CU LUC C1CU111. 

These gentle exercises offer extraordinary health benefits, and are particularly 
appropriate for older individuals who have a harder time staying fit. 

Tai chi has been shown, among other things, to slow the development of 
osteoporosis and Parkinson’s disease, to increase circulation, and to improve 
muscle tone and flexibility. Its emotional benefits are just as important: It is a 
great shield against stress and depression. 

You don’t need to go to the gym for an hour every day or run marathons. As 
Japanese centenarians show us, all you need is to add movement to your day. 
Practicing any of these Eastern disciplines on a regular basis is a great way to do 
so. An added benefit is that they all have well-defined steps, and as we saw in 
chapter IV, disciplines with clear rules are good for flow. If you don’t like any of 
these disciplines, feel free to choose a practice that you love and that makes you 
move. 

In the following pages we’ll take a look at some of the practices that promote 
health and longevity—but first, a little appetizer: a singularly Japanese exercise 
for starting your day. 


Radio taiso 

This morning warm-up has been around since before World War II. The “radio” 
part of its name is from when the instructions for each exercise were transmitted 
over the radio, but today people usually do these movements while tuned to a 
television channel or Internet video demonstrating the steps. 

One of the main purposes of doing radio taiso is to promote a spirit of unity 
among participants. The exercises are always done in groups, usually in schools 
before the start of classes, and in businesses before the workday begins. 

Statistics show that 30 percent of Japanese practice radio taiso for a few 
minutes every morning, but radio taiso is one thing that almost everyone we 
interviewed in Ogimi had in common. Even the residents of the nursing home we 
visited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the 
exercises from their wheelchairs. We joined them on their daily practice and we 
felt refreshed for the rest of the day. 

When these exercises are done in a group, it is usually on a sports field or in a 
large reception hall, and typically involves some kind of loudspeaker. 

The exercises take five or ten minutes, depending on whether you do all or 
only some of them. They focus on dynamic stretching and increasing joint 


mobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raising 
your arms above your head and then bringing them down in a circular motion. It 
is a tool to wake up the body, an easy mobility workout that is low in intensity 
and that focuses on exercising as many joints as possible. 

It might seem basic, but in our modern lives, we can spend days without 
raising our arms above our ears. Think about it: our arms are down when using 
computers, when using smartphones, when reading books. One of the few times 
we raise our hands over our heads is when reaching for something in a cupboard 
or closet, while our ancestors were raising their hands over their heads all the 
time when gathering things from trees. Radio taiso helps us to practice all the 
basic movements of the body.

Yoga 

Popular in Japan as well as in the West, yoga can be done by almost anyone. 

Some of its poses have even been adapted for pregnant women and practitioners 
with physical disabilities. 

Yoga comes from India, where it was developed millennia ago to unite our 
mental and physical elements. The word yoga itself comes from the Sanskrit term 
for “yoke,” which refers to the crosspiece that binds draft animals to one another 
and to the cart they’re pulling. Yoga strives to unite body and mind in the same 
way, guiding us toward a healthy lifestyle in harmony with the world around us. 
The main objectives of yoga are: 

■ To bring us closer to our (human) nature 

■ Mental and physical purification 

■ To bring us closer to the divine 

Styles of yoga 

Though all are oriented toward similar goals, there are many different types of 
yoga that vary according to the traditions and texts from which they were 
developed. The differences among them lie, as the masters say, in the path taken 
to the summit of our best self. 

■ Jnana yoga : the yoga of wisdom; the search for discipline and mental 
growth 

■ Karma yoga : focuses on action, on tasks and duties that benefit oneself and 
one’s community 

■ Bhakti yoga : the yoga of devotion and surrender to the divine 

■ Mantra yoga : focuses on the recitation of mantras to reach a state of 
relaxation 

■ Kundalini yoga : combines diverse steps to reach the desired mental state 

■ Raja yoga: also known as the royal path; encompasses a range of steps 
geared toward achieving communion with oneself and others 

■ Hatha yoga: the most widespread form in the West and Japan; characterized 
by asanas or poses combined in a quest for balance 


How to do a Sun Salutation 


The Sun Salutation is one of the most iconic exercises in hatha yoga. To do it, you 

simply have to follow these twelve basic movements: 

1. With your feet together, stand up straight but keep your muscles relaxed. 
Exhale. 

2. Place the palms of your hands together in front of your chest; from this 
position, inhale as you raise your arms above your head and bend backward 
slightly. 

3. Exhale as you bend forward until you touch the ground with the palms of 
your hands, without bending your knees. 

4. Stretch one leg back to touch the floor with the tips of your toes. Inhale. 

5. Bring the other leg back, keeping your legs and arms straight, as you hold 
your breath. 

6. As you exhale, bend your arms and bring your chest to the ground and then 
forward, resting your knees on the ground. 

7. Straighten your arms and bend your spine back, keeping the lower half of 
your body on the ground. Inhale. 

8. With your hands and feet on the ground, lift your hips until your arms and 
legs are straight and your body forms an upside-down V. Exhale throughout 
the movement. 

9. Bring forward the same leg you’d stretched back earlier and bend it so that 
your knee and foot are aligned under your head and between your hands. 
Inhale. 

10. Exhale as you bring your back foot forward and straighten your legs, keeping 
your hands on the ground as in posture 3. 

11. Bring your arms above your head with your palms together and bend 
backward slightly, as you did in posture 2, while you inhale. 

12. Lower your arms to their initial position in mountain pose while you exhale. 

You’ve just greeted the sun; now you’re ready to have a fantastic day. 








Exhale 


Inhale 



Tai chi 

Also known as t’ai chi ch’uan (or taijiquan), tai chi is a Chinese martial art that 
can be traced back hundreds of years to Buddhism and Confucianism; it is very 
popular in Japan, too. 

According to Chinese tradition, it was created by the Taoist master and martial 
arts practitioner Zhang Sanfeng, though it was Yang Luchan who in the 
nineteenth century brought the form to the rest of the world. 





Tai chi was originally a neijia, or internal martial art, meaning its goal was 
personal growth. Focused on self-defense, it teaches those who practice it to 
defeat their adversaries by using the least amount of force possible and by relying 
on agility. 

Tai chi, which was also seen as a means of healing body and mind, would go 
on to be used more frequently to foster health and inner peace. To encourage its 
citizens to be more active, the Chinese government promoted it as an exercise, 
and it lost its original connection to martial arts, becoming instead a source of 
health and well-being accessible to all. 

Styles of tai chi 

There are different schools and styles of tai chi. The following are the best 
known: 

■ Chen-style : alternates between slow movements and explosive ones 

■ Yang-style : the most widespread of the forms; characterized by slow, fluid 
movements 

■ Wu-style : utilizes small, slow, deliberate movements 

■ Hao-style : centered on internal movements, with almost microscopic 
external movements; one of the least practiced forms of tai chi, even in 
China 

Despite their differences, these styles all have the same objectives: 

1. To control movement through stillness 

2. To overcome force through finesse 

3. To move second and arrive first 

4. To know yourself and your opponent 

The ten basic principles of tai chi 

According to the master Yang Chengfu, the correct practice of tai chi follows ten 
basic principles: 


1. Elevate the crown of your head, and focus all your energy there. 

2. Tighten your chest and expand your back to lighten your lower body. 



3. Relax your waist and let it guide your body. 

4. Learn to differentiate between heaviness and lightness, knowing how your 
weight is distributed. 

5. Relax the shoulders to allow free movement of the arms and promote the 
flow of energy. 

6. Value the agility of the mind over the strength of the body. 

7. Unify the upper and lower body so they act in concert. 

8. Unify the internal and the external to synchronize mind, body, and breath. 

9. Do not break the flow of your movement; maintain fluidity and harmony. 

10. Look for stillness in movement. An active body leads to a calm mind. 

Imitating clouds 

One of the best-known movements in tai chi consists of following the form of 
clouds in an exercise called Wave Hands Like Clouds. Here are the steps: 

1. Extend your arms in front of you with your palms down. 

2. Turn your palms to face in, as though you were hugging a tree trunk. 

3. Open your arms out to the side. 

4. Bring the left arm up and center, and the right arm down and center. 

5. Trace the shape of a ball in front of your body. 

6. Turn your left palm toward your face. 

7. Shift your weight to your left foot and pivot from your hip toward that side, 
while your eyes follow the movement of your hand. 

8. Bring your left hand to your waist and your right hand in front of your face. 

9. Shift your weight to your right foot. 

10. Pivot toward your right, looking at your raised right hand the entire time. 

11. Repeat this movement fluidly, shifting your weight from one foot to the 
other as you reposition your hands. 

12. Stretch your arms out in front of you again and bring them down slowly, 
returning to your initial position. 




Qigong 

Also known as chi kung, its name combines qi (life force, or energy) and gong 
(work), indicating that the form works with the individual’s life force. Though 
relatively modern, especially under its current name, the art of qigong is based on 
the Tao yin, an ancient art meant to foster mental and physical well-being. 

The practice began to appear in reports on training and martial arts at the 
beginning of the twentieth century, and by the 1930s was being used in hospitals. 
The Chinese government later popularized it, as it had done with tai chi. 

Qigong involves static and dynamic physical exercises that stimulate 
respiration in a standing, seated, or reclined position. There are many different 
styles of qigong, but all of them seek to strengthen and regenerate qi. Though its 
movements are typically gentle, the practice is intense. 

Benefits of qigong 

According to numerous international scientific studies, qigong—like tai chi and 
yoga—offers significant health benefits. The following stand out among those 




















































proven through scientific research, as observed by Dr. Kenneth M. Sancier of San 
Francisco’s Qigong Institute in his article “Medical Applications of Qigong”-: 

■ Modification of brain waves 

■ Improved balance of sex hormones 

■ Lower mortality rate from heart attacks 

■ Lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension 

■ Greater bone density 

■ Better circulation 

■ Deceleration of symptoms associated with senility 

■ Greater balance and efficiency of bodily functions 

■ Increased blood flow to the brain and greater mind-body connection 

■ Improved cardiac function 

■ Reduction in the secondary effects of cancer treatments 

Practicing these arts not only keeps us in shape, it also helps extend our lives. 

Methods for practicing qigong 

In order to practice qigong correctly, we should remember that our life energy 
flows through our whole body. We should know how to regulate its many parts: 

1. Tyau Shenn: (regulating the body) by adopting the correct posture—it is 
important to be firmly rooted to the ground 

2. Tyau Shyi : (regulating the breath) until it is calm, steady, and peaceful 

3. Tyau Hsin : (regulating the mind); the most complicated part, as it implies 
emptying the mind of thoughts 

4. Tyau Chi : (regulating the life force) through the regulation of the three prior 
elements, so that it flows naturally 

5. Tyau Shen: (regulating the spirit); the spirit is both strength and root in battle, 
as Yang Jwing-Ming explains in The Essence of Taiji Qigong. - 

In this way, the whole organism will be prepared to work together toward a 
single goal. 


The five elements of qigong 



Une ot qigong s best-known exercises is a series representing the live elements: 
earth, water, wood, metal, and fire. This series of movements seeks to balance the 
five currents of energy in order to improve brain and organ function. 

There are several ways to do these movements. In this case, we’re following 
the model of Professor Maria Isabel Garda Monreal from the Qigong Institute in 
Barcelona. 

EARTH 

1. Stand with your legs apart and your feet directly below your shoulders. 

2. Turn your feet outward slightly to strengthen the posture. 

3. Keep your shoulders relaxed and down and your arms loose at your sides, 
slightly away from your body (this is the Wu Qi, or rooted, posture). 

4. As you inhale, raise your arms in front of you until your hands are level with 
your shoulders, your palms facing down. 

5. Exhale as you bend your knees and bring your arms down until your hands 
are level with your stomach, your palms facing in. 

6. Hold this position for a few seconds, focusing on your breath.

WATER 



1. Starting from Earth posture, bend your knees into a squat, keeping your chest 
upright and exhaling throughout. 

2. Press your coccyx downward to stretch your lumbar spine. 

3. As you inhale, stand to return to Earth posture. 

4. 4. Repeat twice, for a total of three. 



WOOD 

1. Starting from Earth posture, turn your palms upward and open your arms to 
the side, forming a circle as you inhale, until your hands are level with your 
clavicle. Turn your hands so that your palms and elbows point downward, 
while keeping your shoulders relaxed. 

2. Reverse the movement as you exhale, making a downward circle with your 
arms until you reach your initial position. 

3. Repeat twice, for a total of three. 




METAL 

1. Starting from Earth posture, raise your arms until your hands are level with 
your sternum. 

2. Turn your palms toward each other, about four inches apart, with your 
fingers relaxed and slightly separated, pointing upward. 

3. As you inhale, move your hands away from each other until they are shoulder 
width apart. 

4. As you exhale, bring your hands toward each other until they are back in 
position 2. 

5. Repeat twice, for a total of three, observing the concentration of energy as 
you bring your hands together in front of your lungs. 






FIRE 

1. Starting from Earth posture, bring your hands level with your heart as you 
inhale, with one hand slightly above the other and your palms facing each 
other. 

2. Rotate your hands to feel the energy of your heart. 

3. Turn from your waist gently to the left, keeping your torso relaxed and your 
forearms parallel to the ground. 

4. With your palms still facing each other, separate your hands, bringing one up 
until it is level with your shoulder, and the other down in front of your 
abdomen. 

5. Turn from your waist gently to the right, keeping your torso relaxed and your 
forearms parallel to the ground. 

6. As you exhale, let your hands come back together in front of your heart. 

7. With your palms still facing each other, separate your hands, bringing one up 
until it is level with your shoulder, and the other down in front of your 
abdomen. 




COMPLETING THE SERIES 


1. Starting from Earth posture, inhale as you bring your hands level with your 
shoulders, palms facing down. 

2. As you exhale, lower your arms to rest at your sides, returning to the initial 
Wu Qi posture. 



Shiatsu 



































Created in Japan in the early twentieth century, principally for the treatment of 
arthritis, shiatsu also works on energy flow through the application of pressure 
with the thumbs and the palms of the hands. In combination with stretching and 
breathing exercises, it seeks to create equilibrium among the different elements 
of the body. 

It is not important that a Tao Yin* have a name, is imitating something, or is 
engraved in jade. What is important is the technique and the essence of 
what is really practiced. Stretching and contracting, bending and lifting of 
the head, stepping, lying down, resting or standing, walking or stepping 
slowly, screaming or breathing—everything can be a Tao Yin.

Breathe better, live longer 

The book Xiuzhen shishu, known in the West as Ten Books on the Cultivation of 
Perfection, dates back to the thirteenth century and is a compendium of materials 
from diverse sources on developing the mind and body. 

It quotes, among others, the celebrated Chinese doctor and essayist Sun 
Simiao, who lived during the sixth century. Sun Simiao was a proponent of a 
technique called the Six Healing Sounds, which involves the coordination of 
movement, breathing, and pronouncing sounds with the purpose of bringing our 
souls to a place of calm. 

The six sounds are: 

Xu, pronounced like “shh” with a deep sigh, which is associated with the liver 
He, pronounced like “her” with a yawn, which is associated with the heart 
Si, pronounced like “sir” with a slow exhale, which is associated with the lungs 
Chui, pronounced like “chwee” with a forceful exhale, which is associated 
with the kidneys 

Hoo, pronounced like “who,” which is associated with the spleen 
Xi, pronounced like “she, ” which connects the whole body 

The following poem by Sun Simiao offers clues about how to live well 
according to the season. It reminds us of the importance of breathing, and 


suggests that as we breathe, we visualize the organs associated with each of the 
healing sounds. 


In spring, breathe xu for clear eyes and so wood can aid your liver. 

In summer, reach for he, so that heart and fire can be at peace. 

In fall, breathe si to stabilize and gather metal, keeping the lungs moist.

It might feel confusing to be presented with all the Eastern traditions we have 
introduced in this chapter. The takeaway is that they all combine a physical 
exercise with an awareness of our breath. These two components—movement 
and breath—help us to bring our consciousness in line with our body, instead of 
allowing our mind to be carried away by the sea of daily worries. Most of the 
time, we are just not aware enough of our breathing. 




RESILIENCE AND WABI-SABI 

How to face life’s challenges 
without letting stress and worry age 
you 



What is resilience? 


One thing that everyone with a clearly defined ikigai has in common is that they 
pursue their passion no matter what. They never give up, even when the cards 
seem stacked against them or they face one hurdle after another. 

We’re talking about resilience, a concept that has become influential among 
psychologists. 

But resilience isn’t just the ability to persevere. As we’ll see in this chapter, it 
is also an outlook we can cultivate to stay focused on the important things in life 
rather than what is most urgent, and to keep ourselves from being carried away by 
negative emotions. 

In the final section of the chapter, we’ll explore techniques that go beyond 
resilience to cultivate antifragility. 

Sooner or later, we all have to face difficult moments, and the way we do this 
can make a huge difference to our quality of life. Proper training for our mind, 
body, and emotional resilience is essential for confronting life’s ups and downs. 


Nana korobi ya oki ""tlzilf 
Fall seven times, rise eight. 

—Japanese proverb 

Resilience is our ability to deal with setbacks. The more resilient we are, the 
easier it will be to pick ourselves up and get back to what gives meaning to our 
lives. 

Resilient people know how to stay focused on their objectives, on what 
matters, without giving in to discouragement. Their flexibility is the source of 
their strength: They know how to adapt to change and to reversals of fortune. 
They concentrate on the things they can control and don’t worry about those they 
can’t. 

In the words of the famous Serenity Prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr: 


God, give us grace to accept with serenity 
the things that cannot be changed, 
Courage to change the things 
which should be changed, 
and the Wisdom to distinguish 


the one from the other. 


Emotional resilience through Buddhism and Stoicism 

Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha) was born a prince of Kapilavastu, Nepal, and grew 
up in a palace, surrounded by riches. At sixteen he married and had a child. 

Not satisfied by his family’s wealth, at twenty-nine he decided to try a 
different lifestyle and ran away from the palace to live as an ascetic. But it wasn’t 
asceticism that he was looking for; it didn’t offer the happiness and well-being he 
sought. Neither wealth nor extreme asceticism worked for him. He realized that a 
wise person should not ignore life’s pleasures. A wise person can live with these 
pleasures but should always remain conscious of how easy it is to be enslaved by 
them. 

Zeno of Citium began his studies with the Cynics. The Cynics also led ascetic 
lives, leaving behind all earthly pleasures. They lived in the street, and the only 
thing they owned was the clothing on their backs. 

Seeing that Cynicism did not give him a sense of well-being, Zeno abandoned 
its teachings to found the school of Stoicism, which centers on the idea that there 
is nothing wrong with enjoying life’s pleasures as long as they do not take control 
of your life as you enjoy them. You have to be prepared for those pleasures to 
disappear. 

The goal is not to eliminate all feelings and pleasures from our lives, as in 
Cynicism, but to eliminate negative emotions. 

Since their inception, one of the objectives of both Buddhism and Stoicism 
has been to control pleasure, emotions, and desires. Though the philosophies are 
very different, both aim to curb our ego and control our negative emotions. 

Both Stoicism and Buddhism are, at their roots, methods for practicing well¬ 
being. 

According to Stoicism, our pleasures and desires are not the problem. We can 
enjoy them as long as they don’t take control of us. The Stoics viewed those who 
were able to control their emotions as virtuous. 


What’s the worst thing that could happen? 

We finally land our dream job, but after a little while we are already hunting for a 
better one. We win the lottery and buy a nice car but then decide we can’t live 


without a sailboat. We finally win the heart of the man or woman we’ve been 
pining for and suddenly find we have a wandering eye. 

People can be insatiable. 

The Stoics believed that these kinds of desires and ambitions are not worth 
pursuing. The objective of the virtuous person is to reach a state of tranquility 
(apatheia): the absence of negative feelings such as anxiety, fear, shame, vanity, 
and anger, and the presence of positive feelings such as happiness, love, serenity, 
and gratitude. 

In order to keep their minds virtuous, the Stoics practiced something like 
negative visualization: They imagined the worst thing that could happen in order 
to be prepared if certain privileges and pleasures were taken from them. 

To practice negative visualization, we have to reflect on negative events, but 
without worrying about them. 

Seneca, one of the richest men in ancient Rome, lived a life of luxury but was, 
nonetheless, an active Stoic. He recommended practicing negative visualization 
every night before falling asleep. In fact, he not only imagined these negative 
situations, he actually put them into practice—for example, by living for a week 
without servants, or the food and drink he was used to as a wealthy man. As a 
result, he was able to answer the question “What’s the worst thing that could 
happen?” 


Meditating for healthier emotions 

In addition to negative visualization and not giving in to negative emotions, 
another central tenet of Stoicism is knowing what we can control and what we 
can’t , as we see in the Serenity Prayer. 

Worrying about things that are beyond our control accomplishes nothing. We 
should have a clear sense of what we can change and what we can’t, which in turn 
will allow us to resist giving in to negative emotions. 

In the words of Epictetus, “It’s not what happens to you, but how you react that 
matter s.”- 

In Zen Buddhism, meditation is a way to become aware of our desires and 
emotions and thereby free ourselves from them. It is not simply a question of 
keeping the mind free of thoughts but instead involves observing our thoughts 
and emotions as they appear, without getting carried away by them. In this way, 
we train our minds not to get swept up in anger, jealousy, or resentment. 


One of the most commonly used mantras in Buddhism focuses on controlling 
negative emotions: “Om mani padme hum in which om is the generosity that 
purifies the ego, ma is the ethics that purifies jealousy, ni is the patience that 
purifies passion and desire, pad is the precision that purifies bias, me is the 
surrender that purifies greed, and hum is the wisdom that purifies hatred. 


The here and now, and the impermanence of things 

Another key to cultivating resilience is knowing in which time to live. Both 
Buddhism and Stoicism remind us that the present is all that exists, and it is the 
only thing we can control. Instead of worrying about the past or the future, we 
should appreciate things just as they are in the moment, in the now. 

“The only moment in which you can be truly alive is the present moment,” 
observes the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh. 

In addition to living in the here and now, the Stoics recommend reflecting on 
the impermanence of the things around us. 

The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius said that the things we love are like the 
leaves of a tree: They can fall at any moment with a gust of wind. He also said 
that changes in the world around us are not accidental but rather form part of the 
essence of the universe—a rather Buddhist notion, in fact. 

We should never forget that everything we have and all the people we love will 
disappear at some point. This is something we should keep in mind, but without 
giving in to pessimism. Being aware of the impermanence of things does not have 
to make us sad; it should help us love the present moment and those who 
surround us. 

“All things human are short-lived and perishable,” Seneca tells us.= 

The temporary, ephemeral, and impermanent nature of the world is central to 
every Buddhist discipline. Keeping this always in mind helps us avoid excessive 
pain in times of loss. 


Wabi-sabi and ichi-go ichi-e 

Wabi-sabi is a Japanese concept that shows us the beauty of the fleeting, 
changeable, and imperfect nature of the world around us. Instead of searching for 
beauty in perfection, we should look for it in things that are flawed, incomplete.

cracked teacup. Only things that are imperfect, incomplete, and ephemeral can 
truly be beautiful, because only those things resemble the natural world. 

A complementary Japanese concept is that of ichi-go ichi-e, which could be 
translated as “This moment exists only now and won’t come again.” It is heard 
most often in social gatherings as a reminder that each encounter—whether with 
friends, family, or strangers—is unique and will never be repeated, meaning that 
we should enjoy the moment and not lose ourselves in worries about the past or 
the future. 

The concept is commonly used in tea ceremonies, Zen meditation, and 
Japanese martial arts, all of which place emphasis on being present in the 
moment. 

In the West, we’ve grown accustomed to the permanence of the stone 
buildings and cathedrals of Europe, which sometimes gives us the sense that 
nothing changes, making us forget about the passage of time. Greco-Roman 
architecture adores symmetry, sharp lines, imposing facades, and buildings and 
statues of the gods that outlast the centuries. 

Japanese architecture, on the other hand, doesn’t try to be imposing or perfect, 
because it is built in the spirit of wabi-sabi. The tradition of making structures out 
of wood presupposes their impermanence and the need for future generations to 
rebuild them. Japanese culture accepts the fleeting nature of the human being and 
everything we create. 

The Grand Shrine of Ise,- for example, has been rebuilt every twenty years for 
centuries. The most important thing is not to keep the building standing for 
generations, but to preserve customs and traditions—things that can withstand the 
passage of time better than structures made by human hands. 

The key is to accept that there are certain things over which we have no 
control, like the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of the world around us. 

Ichi-go ichi-e teaches us to focus on the present and enjoy each moment that 
life brings us. This is why it is so important to find and pursue our ikigai. 

Wabi-sabi teaches us to appreciate the beauty of imperfection as an 
opportunity for growth. 


Beyond resilience: Antifragility 

As the legend goes, the first time Hercules faced the Hydra, he despaired when 
he discovered that cutting off one of its heads meant that two would grow back in 


its place. He would never be able to kill the beast if it got stronger with every 
wound. 

As Nassim Nicholas Taleb explains in Antifragile: Things That Gain from 
Disorder,- we use the word fragile to describe people, things, and organizations 
that are weakened when harmed, and the words robust and resilient for things that 
are able to withstand harm without weakening, but we don’t have a word for 
things that get stronger when harmed (up to a point). 

To refer to the kind of power possessed by the Hydra of Lerna, to talk about 
things that get stronger when they are harmed, Taleb proposes the term 
antifragile: “Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists 
shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.” 

Catastrophes and exceptional circumstances offer good models for explaining 
antifragility. In 2011 a tsunami hit the Tohoku region of Japan, doing tremendous 
damage to dozens of cities and towns along the coast, most famously Fukushima. 

When we visited the affected coast two years after the catastrophe, having 
driven for hours along cracked highways and past one empty gas station after 
another, we passed through several ghost towns whose streets had been taken over 
by the remnants of houses, piles of cars, and empty train stations. These towns 
were fragile spaces that had been forgotten by the government and could not 
recover on their own. 

Other places, such as Ishinomaki and Kesennuma, suffered extensive damage 
but were rebuilt within a few years, thanks to the efforts of many. Ishinomaki and 
Kesennuma showed how resilient they were in their ability to return to normal 
after the catastrophe. 

The earthquake that caused the tsunami also affected the Fukushima nuclear 
power plant. The Tokyo Electric Power Company engineers working at the plant 
were not prepared to recover from that kind of damage. The Fukushima nuclear 
facility is still in a state of emergency and will be for decades to come. It 
demonstrated its fragility in the face of an unprecedented catastrophe. 

The Japanese financial markets closed minutes after the earthquake. Which 
businesses did the best in the aftermath? Stock in big construction companies has 
been steadily on the rise since 2011; the need to rebuild the entire coast of 
Tohoku is a boon for construction. In this case, Japanese construction companies 
are antifragile, since they benefited enormously from the catastrophe. 

Now let’s take a look at how we can apply this concept to our daily lives. How 
can we be more antifragile? 


btep i: ureate reaunaancies 

Instead of having a single salary, try to find a way to make money from your 
hobbies, at other jobs, or by starting your own business. If you have only one 
salary, you might be left with nothing should your employer run into trouble, 
leaving you in a position of fragility. On the other hand, if you have several 
options and you lose your primary job, it might just happen that you end up 
dedicating more time to your secondary job, and maybe even make more money 
at it. You would have beaten that stroke of bad luck and would be, in that case, 
antifragile. 

One hundred percent of the seniors we interviewed in Ogimi had a primary 
and a secondary occupation. Most of them kept a vegetable garden as a secondary 
job, and sold their produce at the local market. 

The same idea goes for friendships and personal interests. It’s just a matter, as 
the saying goes, of not putting all your eggs in one basket. 

In the sphere of romantic relationships, there are those who focus all their 
energy on their partner and make him or her their whole world. Those people lose 
everything if the relationship doesn’t work out, whereas if they’ve cultivated 
strong friendships and a full life along the way, they’ll be in a better position to 
move on at the end of a relationship. They’ll be antifragile. 

Right now you might be thinking, “I don’t need more than one salary, and I’m 
happy with the friends I’ve always had. Why should I add anything new?” It might 
seem like a waste of time to add variation to our lives, because extraordinary 
things don’t ordinarily happen. We slip into a comfort zone. But the unexpected 
always happens, sooner or later. 

Step 2: Bet conservatively in certain areas and take many small 
risks in others 

The world of finance turns out to be very useful in explaining this concept. If you 
have $10,000 saved up, you might put $9,000 of that into an index fund or fixed- 
term deposit, and invest the remaining $1,000 in ten start-ups with huge growth 
potential—say, $100 in each. 

One possible scenario is that three of the companies fail (you lose $300), the 
value of three other companies goes down (you lose another $100 or $200), the 
value of three goes up (you make $100 or $200), and the value of one of the start¬ 
ups increases twenty-fold (you make nearly $2,000, or maybe even more). 

You still make money, even if three of the businesses go completely belly-up.

i uu vc uciicincu iium me uamage, juj>l iijvc uic rxyuia.. 

The key to becoming antifragile is taking on small risks that might lead to 
great reward, without exposing ourselves to dangers that might sink us, such as 
investing $10,000 in a fund of questionable reputation that we saw advertised in 
the newspaper. 

Step 3: Get rid of the things that make you fragile 

We’re taking the negative route for this exercise. Ask yourself: What makes me 
fragile? Certain people, things, and habits generate losses for us and make us 
vulnerable. Who and what are they? 

When we make our New Year’s resolutions, we tend to emphasize adding new 
challenges to our lives. It’s great to have this kind of objective, but setting “good 
riddance” goals can have an even bigger impact. For example: 

■ Stop snacking between meals 

■ Eat sweets only once a week 

■ Gradually pay off all debt 

■ Avoid spending time with toxic people 

■ Avoid spending time doing things we don’t enjoy, simply because we feel 
obligated to do them 

■ Spend no more than twenty minutes on Facebook per day 

To build resilience into our lives, we shouldn’t fear adversity, because each 
setback is an opportunity for growth. If we adopt an antifragile attitude, we’ll find 
a way to get stronger with every blow, refining our lifestyle and staying focused 
on our ikigai. 

Taking a hit or two can be viewed as either a misfortune or an experience that 
we can apply to all areas of our lives, as we continually make corrections and set 
new and better goals. As Taleb writes in Antifragile, “We need randomness, mess, 
adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, hear traumatic episodes, all these things 
that make life worth living.” We encourage those interested in the concept of 
antifragility to read Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Antifragile. 

Life is pure imperfection, as the philosophy of wabi-sabi teaches us, and the 
passage of time shows us that everything is fleeting, but if you have a clear sense 
of your ikigai, each moment will hold so many possibilities that it will seem 
almost like an eternity. 



EPILOGUE 


Ikigai : The art of living 


Mitsuo Aida was one of the most important calligraphers and haikuists of the 
twentieth century. He is yet another example of a Japanese person who dedicated 
his life to a very specific ikigai: communicating emotions with seventeen-syllable 
poems, using a shodo calligraphy brush. 

Many of Aida’s haikus philosophize about the importance of the present 
moment, and the passage of time. The poem reproduced below could be 
translated as “In the here and now, the only thing in my life is your life.” 

Ulk <_ <_ L U \ ^Otz. U 
CDlUDS^^/cCDlUDS 

In another poem, Aida writes simply, “Here, now.” It is an artwork that seeks 
to evoke feelings of mono no aware (a melancholy appreciation of the 
ephemeral). 


US 


The following poem touches on one of the secrets of bringing ikigai into our 
lives: “Happiness is always determined by your heart.” 




This last one, also by Aida, means “Keep going; don’t change your path.” 





Once you discover your ikigai, pursuing it and nurturing it every day will bring 
meaning to your life. The moment your life has this purpose, you will achieve a 
happy state of flow in all you do, like the calligrapher at his canvas or the chef 
who, after half a century, still prepares sushi for his patrons with love. 


Conclusion 

Our ikigai is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we 
are all searching for meaning. When we spend our days feeling connected to what 
is meaningful to us, we live more fully; when we lose the connection, we feel 
despair. 

Modem life estranges us more and more from our true nature, making it very 
easy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning. Powerful forces and incentives 
(money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; don’t let them take 
over your life. 

Our intuition and curiosity are very powerful internal compasses to help us 
connect with our ikigai. Follow those things you enjoy, and get away from or 
change those you dislike. Be led by your curiosity, and keep busy by doing things 
that fill you with meaning and happiness. It doesn’t need to be a big thing: we 
might find meaning in being good parents or in helping our neighbors. 

There is no perfect strategy to connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned 
from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it. 

Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that 
keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who 
love you. 


The ten rules of ikigai 

We’ll conclude this journey with ten rules we’ve distilled from the wisdom of the 
long-living residents of Ogimi: 


1. Stay active; don’t retire. Those who give up the things they love doing and 
do well lose their purpose in life. That’s why it’s so important to keep doing 
things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping 
out, and shaping the world around you, even after your ‘‘official” professional 
activity has ended. 

2. Take it slow. Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As 
the old saying goes, “Walk slowly and you’ll go far.” When we leave urgency 
behind, life and time take on new meaning. 

3. Don’t fill your stomach. Less is more when it comes to eating for long life, 
too. According to the 80 percent rule, in order to stay healthier longer, we should 
eat a little less than our hunger demands instead of stuffing ourselves. 

4. Surround yourself with good friends. Friends are the best medicine, 
there for confiding worries over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your 
day, getting advice, having fun, dreaming ... in other words, living. 

5. Get in shape for your next birthday. Water moves; it is at its best when it 
flows fresh and doesn’t stagnate. The body you move through life in needs a bit 
of daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases 
hormones that make us feel happy. 

6. Smile. A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing—it also helps make friends. 
It’s good to recognize the things that aren’t so great, but we should never forget 
what a privilege it is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities. 

7. Reconnect with nature. Though most people live in cities these days, 
human beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it 
often to recharge our batteries. 

8. Give thanks. To your ancestors, to nature, which provides you with the air 
you breathe and the food you eat, to your friends and family, to everything that 
brightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive. Spend a moment every 
day giving thanks, and you’ll watch your stockpile of happiness grow. 

9. Live in the moment. Stop regretting the past and fearing the future. Today 
is all you have. Make the most of it. Make it worth remembering. 

10. Follow your ikigai. There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that 
gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the 
very end. If you don’t know what your ikigai is yet, as Viktor Frankl says, your 
mission is to discover it. 

The authors of this book wish you a long, happy, and purposeful life.

891236891323,Dracula,Bram Stoker,Horror,English,2024-04-02,"Dracula begins with Jonathan Harker, a young English lawyer, as he travels to Transylvania. Harker plans to meet with Count Dracula, a client of his firm, in order to finalize a property transaction. When he arrives in Transylvania, the locals react with terror after he discloses his destination: Castle Dracula. Though this unsettles him slightly, he continues onward. The ominous howling of wolves rings through the air as he arrives at the castle.

When Harker meets Dracula, he acknowledges that the man is pale, gaunt, and strange. Harker becomes further concerned when, after Harker cuts himself while shaving, Dracula lunges at his throat. Soon after, Harker is seduced by three female vampires, from whom he barely escapes. He then learns Dracula’s secret—that he is a vampire and survives by drinking human blood. Harker correctly assumes that he is to be the count’s next victim. He attacks the count, but his efforts are unsuccessful. Dracula leaves Harker trapped in the castle and then, along with 50 boxes of dirt, departs for England.

Lucy Westernra’s fate
Meanwhile, in England, Harker’s fiancée Mina is visiting a friend named Lucy Westenra, who has recently gotten engaged after declining a number of suitors. One night Mina must search for Lucy, as she has fallen back into her old habit of sleepwalking. When Mina finds her outside near a graveyard, there appears to be a shape hovering over her for a split second. Mina notices two small red marks on Lucy’s neck and assumes that she must have inadvertently pricked Lucy with a pin. Over the following days, Lucy falls ill and is at times seen through a window next to a bat. Mina is worried, but she is called away once she receives correspondence from Jonathan. Lucy goes into the care of Dr. Seward and Dr. Van Helsing, who, after a number of failed blood transfusions, decide further action is needed. They then drape Lucy and her room with garlic—a strategy used to ward off vampires. Lucy, however, soon dies.

After her death, many report the appearance of a creature who is attacking children in the area. When Jonathan (who was able to escape Count Dracula’s castle) and Mina return to England, now as a married couple, Jonathan’s accounts of Dracula lead Van Helsing to believe that Lucy contracted vampirism from the count and is the one tormenting the children. In order to prevent her from further killing, they unearth her corpse, stake her through the heart, cut off her head, and stuff her mouth with garlic.

The vampire hunters
Now that Lucy has been taken care of, the group decides to track down Count Dracula and the 50 boxes of dirt he brought with him. According to lore, Dracula needs the dirt of his home country to remain healthy. The group attempts to destroy the boxes so that Dracula has no means of regeneration.

One night, amid feelings of uneasiness toward Mina’s recent behaviour, Van Helsing and Seward break into her room to find Jonathan unconscious and Mina drinking blood from a gash in Dracula’s chest. The vampire disappears and returns to Transylvania only to be followed by the determined group. They find him buried in the final box of dirt and promptly cut off his head and stab him through his heart. Dracula crumbles into dust. The vampire hunters also lose one of their own, Quincey Morris, during the expedition.

Analysis
The vibrancy and complexity of Stoker’s Dracula has provoked a vast range of interpretations and analysis by scholars and critics.

Count Dracula and Vlad the Impaler
A popular theory among critics is that the character Count Dracula is based on the infamously barbaric Vlad III, better known as Vlad the Impaler. Vlad was born in Transylvania in the 15th century and was known popularly as Drăculea, meaning “Son of Dracul” (his father was surnamed Dracul after being appointed to a knightly order called the Order of the Dragon). This name was derived from the Latin draco, meaning “dragon,” the basis for the elder Vlad’s epithet. In modern Romanian, drac has evolved to mean “devil.” Stoker is thought to have picked the name Dracula after reading a book that revealed to him this modern translation. His notes include the annotation “in Wallachian language means DEVIL,” written in response to drac.

The name, however, is not all Dracula and Vlad III have in common. Vlad impaled his enemies on stakes to consolidate his political power in Walachia. One account also claimed that while his victims were dying atop the stakes, Vlad would dip bread in their blood and eat it in front of them, but that account is unconfirmed. Whether Vlad truly consumed blood, the parallels with Stoker’s Dracula remain evident. Some critics, however, have argued that Stoker’s inspiration came primarily from other sources and that Vlad simply provided the name.

Immigration, sexual desire, and gender
Dracula has been interpreted as an expression of anxiety about eastern Europeans invading western Europe, as represented by a Transylvanian who arrives in London and terrorizes its residents. Others see Stoker’s novel as an exploration of suppressed sexual desire and a reaction to the patriarchal and conservative norms broadly prevalent in Britain during the Victorian period. Notably, it inverts the era’s stereotypical gender roles through the highly sexualized actions of the female vampires. Yet Dracula can also be seen as the evil of temptation personified as he preys on women who must then be protected by the men around them (though those men still fail, particularly in Lucy’s case). The novel’s complexity, especially in its representation of gender, allows numerous, sometimes contradictory, interpretations.

The problem of modernity
While vampirism is clearly at the forefront of Stoker’s novel, be it literal, metaphorical, or just for the Gothic scare, Dracula is also preoccupied with modernity. Some critics argue that the novel is about the relationship between the past and the future, with Count Dracula perhaps representing the primitive nature of the past as it permeates the present and challenges modernization. For example, Dracula drains Lucy’s blood, and the newly resurfaced technology of blood infusion fails her. She dies by the hand of the past, despite the use of modern medical technology. Stoker might be acknowledging contemporary suspicions about the effectiveness of new technology. As Jonathan writes in reference to Dracula, “the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere ‘modernity’ cannot kill.”

Dracula’s legacy
Max Schreck in Nosferatu
Max Schreck in Nosferatu
Max Schreck as the vampire in Nosferatu (1922), directed by F.W. Murnau.
Stoker’s Dracula was instrumental in the creation of the vampire trope that has permeated Western popular culture in the forms of novel and film alike. Dracula was well received when it was published, but its success is even better measured by the number of adaptations it inspired. These adaptations began in 1922, when the novel was plagiarized in the silent motion picture Nosferatu, in which the director F.W. Murnau took Stoker’s story, tweaked it, and put the results on the big screen. Stoker’s estate won a lawsuit against the production company responsible for the movie, but the movie had made its way to the United States, where Dracula was already in the public domain. Duplicates were created, and thus Nosferatu survived.

Since then vampires of the same kind have appeared across popular culture. Some of them have been modernized, as in Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight Saga. Others have maintained the integrity of Stoker’s original Count Dracula, as in Stephen King’s Salem’s Lot (1975), a novel King claimed had been inspired by Stoker. Even the American children’s television show Sesame Street developed a character, Count von Count, modeled on Dracula; instead of drinking blood, this vampire counted everything around him (and helped his audience learn simple mathematics).",3,2

Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2023 by BuzzFeed ∙ Paste Magazine ∙ Elle ∙ Southern Living ∙ SheReads ∙ Culturess ∙ Medium ∙ Her Campus ∙ Readers Digest ∙ Zibby Mag and more!

A couple who broke up months ago pretend to still be together for their annual weeklong vacation with their best friends in this glittering and wise new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Emily Henry.
 
Harriet and Wyn have been the perfect couple since they met in college—they go together like salt and pepper, honey and tea, lobster and rolls. Except, now—for reasons they’re still not discussing—they don’t.
 
They broke up five months ago. And still haven’t told their best friends.
 
Which is how they find themselves sharing a bedroom at the Maine cottage that has been their friend group’s yearly getaway for the last decade. Their annual respite from the world, where for one vibrant, blissful week they leave behind their daily lives; have copious amounts of cheese, wine, and seafood; and soak up the salty coastal air with the people who understand them most.
 
Only this year, Harriet and Wyn are lying through their teeth while trying not to notice how desperately they still want each other. Because the cottage is for sale and this is the last week they’ll all have together in this place. They can’t stand to break their friends’ hearts, and so they’ll play their parts. Harriet will be the driven surgical resident who never starts a fight, and Wyn will be the laid-back charmer who never lets the cracks show. It’s a flawless plan (if you look at it from a great distance and through a pair of sunscreen-smeared sunglasses). After years of being in love, how hard can it be to fake it for one week…in front of those who know you best?",4,0
83787289345,Dark Avengers, Mike Deodato,Action,English,2024-04-15,"The government assigned the team's redevelopment to Norman Osborn (the reformed supervillain now calling himself the Iron Patriot) whom the government had previously assigned to head the superhero team the Thunderbolts and who had become a public hero for his role in repelling the Skrull threat. Osborn, also given leadership of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., reforms that agency into H.A.M.M.E.R. and creates a new Avengers team under its aegis.

The initial line-up consists of former Thunderbolts members and new recruits, including the Sentry, Ares, Noh-Varr (now Captain Marvel) as well as disguised super-villains Moonstone (portraying Ms. Marvel), Venom (Mac Gargan portraying Spider-Man after being given a formula that resets the symbiote to the size it was when it possessed Spider-Man), Bullseye (portraying Hawkeye) and Wolverine's disgruntled son Daken taking on the Wolverine mantle. Osborn also takes on the identity of Iron Patriot, wearing a red, white, and blue-themed Iron Man armor.[9] The team goes to Latveria to rescue Doctor Doom from Morgan Le Fay.[10] Upon returning from Latveria, Osborn deals[11] with the aftermath of Hawkeye's appearance on live TV, under his ""Ronin"" alias, reminding the public of Osborn's murderous past and that he should not be trusted.[12] Due to this action, Osborn is forced to ""get rid of"" this problem.

The Dark Avengers arrive in San Francisco to set up martial law and to quell the anti-mutant riots. In doing so, Norman sets up his own team of X-Men consisting of Cloak and Dagger, Mimic, Emma Frost, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Daken, Weapon Omega and Mystique (posing as Professor X) much to the chagrin of his Avengers.[13] After Emma Frost, Namor, and Cloak and Dagger betray the team, Norman swears vengeance on the X-Men.[14]

A series of disappearances throughout Colorado causes Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers (except for Venom) to visit the small town of Dinosaur, Colorado. Everyone except Norman is teleported away, while Osborn finds himself in front of a throne with Molecule Man seated on it, flanked by the Beyonder, Mephisto, Zarathos, and the Enchantress.[15] However, it is revealed that these others were merely Molecule Man's creations. Molecule Man tortures Norman mentally and physically and seemingly kills his Avengers.[16] Osborn's assistant Victoria Hand successfully stalls Molecule Man with a false surrender until the Void is able to reform and kill Molecule Man. It is revealed that the Sentry and the Void have the same powers as Molecule Man. The Sentry regains control of himself and agrees to begin therapy with Moonstone, while Victoria Hand demands Norman to undergo therapy as well after being tortured. Inside his office, Loki is manipulating Norman into having a Green Goblin relapse.[17]

After declaring war on the Asgardians, Norman Osborn has the Dark Avengers and those in The Initiative prepare for the Siege of Asgard.[18] Norman considers The Sentry, specifically his dark side, known as The Void, his secret weapon.[19]

In flashback, it is told how Robert Reynolds received his vast powers from experimental drugs, using his might as the Sentry to live the life of a superhero, while his darker emotions manifested as the Void. Osborn has manipulated Reynolds into allowing the Void to take over, to do Osborn's murderous bidding. Osborn has somehow recreated the addictive serum that gave Reynolds his powers, making him dependent on Osborn and his approval. Meanwhile, Reynolds's wife Lindy has been a virtual prisoner in the Sentry's Watchtower, has even attempted to kill him, and begs Reynolds to either kill her or let her go. Reynolds's warring personalities, however, have stalemated. The Sentry even attempts suicide, flying into the heart of the sun, but such is his invulnerability that it doesn't work. He tires of struggling against the Void. Norman orders Bullseye to kill Lindy, blaming her for Sentry's uncertainty and weakness.[20] When an emergency evacuation occurs, Bullseye takes Lindy on a helicopter, antagonizes her cruelly, then strangles her to death and dumps her body into the ocean. When Sentry arrives looking for Lindy, Bullseye claims that she committed suicide, out of fear of Reynolds, by jumping out of the helicopter in the countryside. Sentry leaves to look for her body. From this point on, it could be said that the murderous Void was in full control of Reynolds and his unprecedented power.[21]

Following the events of Siege, Norman Osborn is incarcerated in The Raft penitentiary. Moonstone, Bullseye and Venom are captured by the heroes, while Daken manages to escape capture by military personnel. After being interrogated by Captain Rogers, Victoria Hand is informed that she has been reassigned.[22] Moonstone joins Luke Cage's incarnation of the Thunderbolts.[23] Noh-Varr is recruited into the Avengers team to help them build a time machine to save the future.[24] Victoria Hand is assigned by Steve Rogers to be the liaison for Luke Cage's team of Avengers, dubbed the New Avengers, because he feels that she can provide an important insight to the team.[25] Bullseye escapes custody and is killed by his longtime nemesis Daredevil when he attacks his fortress of Shadowland during the storyline of the same name. Daken eludes capture at the conclusion of the Siege of Asgard and is confronted by Franken-Castle (whom he had killed during the Dark Reign).

A new Dark Avengers team is formed by Norman Osborn and H.A.M.M.E.R. The roster includes Skaar, Gorgon, Ai Apaec, Dr. June Covington, Superia, and Trickshot. The team is backed up by HYDRA and A.I.M. Norman Osborn also has A.I.M. rebuild Ragnarok so that he can join the Dark Avengers.[27] Although Osborn claims to be certain that his new team is superior to their ""templates,"" he appears unaware that Madame Hydra and Gorgon are already planning to kill him once he proves himself to be too dangerous as leader, intending to use his team to sow discord by serving as a voice of the ""disenfranchised"" unsatisfied with the status quo.[28] The subsequent fight against the New Avengers proves to be relatively evenly matched. Although Osborn demonstrates a surprising new level of strength allowing him to throw Luke Cage a considerable distance and his Scarlet Witch injures Doctor Strange, the others are able to hold their own far more easily. When they attempt to teleport away, the New Avengers end up facing Ragnarok.[29] Spider-Man and Iron Fist are able to defeat Ragnarok, but the Dark Avengers' actions have still damaged the New Avengers' reputations by tricking them into provoking a fight with a team who just helped the civilians,[30] Osborn's other forces attacking the main team to charge them with various war crimes, ordering the President to declare Osborn the new head of world security and put the Avengers on trial.[31]

The Dark Avengers capture Captain America during their successful attack on both Avengers teams with the intention of executing him for his 'crimes'. Gorgon and Superia are already planning to betray the team, while Victoria Hand, apparently Norman's double agent inside the team, reveals to the New Avengers her real allegiance to Captain America and Skaar turns on his teammates after they confirm their intentions to assault Captain America, exclaiming the famous rallying cry, ""Avengers Assemble!"" as he does so.[32] Skaar reveals that he is a double agent for Captain America, allowing the New Avengers to defeat the rest of the team.[33] Norman Osborn is shown to have developed the abilities of the Super-Adaptoid, enabling him to copy the abilities of the other Avengers. The Avengers find a way to overload this power, which puts Norman Osborn into a coma. After Osborn is defeated, the rest of the Dark Avengers are detained. It is suggested in a conversation with Captain America that they be considered for the Thunderbolts Program.[34]

As of #175, Thunderbolts is renamed Dark Avengers with writer Jeff Parker and the art team of Kev Walker and Declan Shalvey remaining on the title.[6][7] When the Thunderbolts are missing in the time stream, the Dark Avengers were recruited as a replacement team. In order to keep the Dark Avengers in line, they were implanted with nanites and placed under the leadership of Luke Cage.[35]

The Dark Avengers team are thrown into the alternate world of Earth-13584 with John Walker (U.S. Agent) where they are captured by that reality's version of Iron Man.[36] It turns out that A.I.M. is behind the reality manipulation. Due to the Dark Avengers' arrival, the solar system is starting to disappear. The Dark Avengers enter the A.I.M. base and accelerate the sliver's destruction. The Dark Avengers arrive back in their world. Skaar hops away, but the rest of the team ponders what to do as most of them are still criminals. June Covington bewitches U.S. Agent into believing they could still work as a team and steps on a still miniaturized Ai Apaec.[37]",3,0
